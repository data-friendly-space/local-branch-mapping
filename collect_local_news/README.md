# collect_local_news

A set of scripts for scraping news articles from national and local newspapers.

## General

Python package requirements are in `reuirements.pip` in the top-level directory.

Everything described below should be run from the `scrape_newspapers` directory.

All scripts take as input a configuration file, a couple of working
examples can be found in the `config_files` directory.

### Configuration files

The configuration files have two sections, `main` and `keywords`.

#### main
`country`: The name of the country, used for finding and labelling files and searching
a newspaper database\
`country_short`: Used for finding the location file, which has the path
 `locations/{country}/{country_short}.txt`\
`keyword`: The keyword to search for in article titles\
`model`: The spaCy model to use\
`language`: The language of the articles (so far
can only be 'english' or 'french'

### keywords
The parameters with names that begin with 'filename' refer to names of
files in the `keywords` directory that contain long lists of keywords.

## Scrape articles

Using the country name specified in the configuration file, searches
all newspapers listed at [ABYZ News links](http://www.abyznewslinks.com/),
and queries for articles with the keyword in the title.

Usage:
```
scrape_articles.py [-h] config_file
```
Output: For each newspaper, a pandas DataFrame of articles, in csv, with
row format: `['title', 'publish_date', 'text', 'url']`. The default
save location is `Articles_{keyword}_{country}/articles_{keyword}_{newspaper}.csv`.

## Inspect and tag articles

Analyze the output of the scraped articles and decide if each article is relevant or not.
This works in 4 steps:

1) A summary csv file is created, or read in if it already exists. This file
contains the title, newspaper name and index of all articles that were scraped, 
as well as a column for marking the relevance as `True` / `False`. It is saved as
`articles_processed/articles_summary_{keyword}_{country}.csv`. 

2) Automisation of the annotation process. 
Based on the the summary dataframe, this script checks the title for words that 
indicate the relevance or not. The result (True/False/blank) is written to the 
column `topical`.
Possible outcomes:
    - Article is relevant --> `True`
    This is based on the keywords in `Article_topical_{country}.txt` and 
    `Locations_{country}.txt`. Article_topical_{country}.txt contains words that
    indicate relevance, e.g. the target country president's name, the name of the
    people ('maliens' for Mali, 'franÃ§ais' for France) and other words indicating 
    relevance of the article.
    Locations_{country}.txt contains a selection of (larger) cities and provinces
    in a country, e.g. from Wikipedia. A complete list of a country's locations
    is not used, since it may also include very small villages that are recognised
    in parts of words and therefore falsly treated as True by the script, e.g. 
    village 'Da' in Mali is recognised in the word 'indonDAtion'.   
    - Article is not relevant --> `False`
    This is based on the keywords in `Article_nontopical_{country}.txt`. Keyword 
    examples are: countries outside target country, 'you searched for', words
    related to the target word ('flood'), but in a different sense: e.g. flooding 
    a 'stadium' with people, or a 'market' is flooded with certain products.
     - Article requires manual inspection of the article text --> left `blank`
    This is based on the keywords in `keys_manual_check` in the Config file. 
    These are be words that have ambiguous meaning: e.g. river 'Niger' 
    in Mali (relevant), or country 'Niger' (not relevant for floods in Mali). 
    This merely functions as a counter for these ambiguous words.
IMPORTANT: Choosing the right keywords voor (non)topical articles is a iterative
exercise. The user had to to check a sample of the annotation results (in Excel), 
to see if they are correct and to find more words to add to the (non)topical lists. 
The scripts prints for every title: the title, index, True/False/Check, and the 
word responsible for the choice of True/False/Check.
NOTE: all keywords need to be written in lower case and with AND without accents.

3) For all articles that still require their relevancy to be assessed,
the user will be shown the title of the article and prompted to evaluate it
as relevant (`y`/`n`). There is also the option `i` to view the article text,
and `q` to quit and save the current results. Only titles will be shown of 
articles where the cell in column `topical` is left blank.

4) The text from all articles with relevance marked as `True` is saved to a new file,
`articles_processed/articles_all_topical_{keyword}_{country}.csv`. 

Usage:
```
python inspect_articles_tag_topical.py [-h] [-r] config_file

positional arguments:
  config_file           Configuration file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r, --recreate-summary-file
                        Recreate the summary file
```
TBI: automatize the process with a classification algorithm, too few data so far.
