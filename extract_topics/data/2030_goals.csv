climate change,"Climate change is one of the biggest risks and a threat multiplier, facing humanity in the coming decades. Rising climate risks already affect almost every aspect of our work, including health, shelter, livelihoods, and disaster risk reduction. Climate change also increases the uncertainties we face and will accelerate displacement in densely populated regions. At the same time, these events will be increasingly complex, compounded by poverty, disease, displacement, and conflict, and interacting with urbanization and population growth, putting increased pressure on scarce natural resources, including the demand for food and water. These intersecting issues is ramping up exposure and vulnerability. From increasing climate-related risks in cities, in regions already suffering from violent conflict, and the grave consequences for the mental health and psychosocial well-being of the individuals and communities who are affected. 
As the world adapts to rising risks and implements what needs to be a radical shift towards a low-carbon economy, our role to address and bring attention to the needs of people in vulnerable situations will be increasingly important. Adaptation and mitigation must be high on our collective agenda for human well-being and integrated into all of our work. We will need to be prepared for and anticipate events ranging from local emergencies to mega-disasters, from predictable events to unexpected disasters. More holistically, we will also dedicate more concentrated efforts to reducing human vulnerability to longer-term consequences of climate change that will threaten development, poverty reduction and water and food security. 
Our focus over the coming decade must be on reducing the current and future humanitarian impacts of climate change and to support people to thrive in the face of it.
Climate change can no longer be viewed in isolation. Climate risk management and the underlying drivers of vulnerability must be integrated into all of our programmes and operations.
We need to embrace early action models, scientific forecasts, and other innovations that can improve our response.
We also need to adopt better environmental management and nature-based solutions in our approaches to addressing exposure and vulnerability. 
As decisions are taken at local, national and global levels to address climate change, our strong humanitarian voice will be critical to foster the right level of ambition on both adaptation and mitigation, but especially also to ensure people in vulnerable situations are not left behind. We will speak out at all levels on the impacts of climate change on current and future humanitarian risk, calling for greater attention to those most at risk and more support for community-level action. To increase our impact in all areas of our work, we will also foster and strengthen new and different types of partnerships drawing on new expertise, outreach and scientific knowledge. We will expand our legislative advocacy, strengthen the Red Cross and Red Crescent Green Response Framework, and strive to reduce our own environmental footprint.","The climate crisis and environmental degregation are significant risks facing humanity and
are already affecting almost every aspect of our work. Changes to our climate and
environment are already contributing to an increase in the frequency, intensity and
unpredictability of severe weather events, and the decline of biodiversity. Without action on
both climate and environmental degradation, their impacts will place increasing pressure on
scarce natural resources, including food, water and clean air.
The world needs to address the factors contributing to our climate and environmental crises
and adapt to the risks that they have and will likely continue to create. We will need to be
prepared for and anticipate events ranging from local emergencies to mega-disasters as well
as both the predictable and unexpected. Our role to bring attention to the needs of those who
are and will become vulnerable is increasingly important. This must be integrated into all
areas of our work.
Our focus over the coming decade will be on reducing the current and future
humanitarian impacts of climate and environmental crises and supporting people to
thrive in the face of it.
We will integrate climate risk management – including adaptation and mitigation – across
all of our programmes, operations and advocacy and adopt better environmental
management in our approaches to addressing exposure and vulnerability.
We will specifically focus on the drivers of vulnerability in livelihoods, food shortages,
health, and climate-related displacement, and within urban environments. We wll embrace
the early action models, scientific forecasts, innovation and financing that can improve our
response.
As decisions are taken at community, local, national and global levels to address climate
change and environmental degradation, our strong collective voice will be critical to
encourage the right level of ambition on both adaptation and mitigation and to ensure people
in vulnerable situations are not left behind.
We will strengthen the Red Cross and Red Crescent Green Response Framework and strive to
reduce our own climate and environmental footprint.","Climate change is one of the defining challenges of our generation, its consequences at the heart of the Red Cross Red Crescent mission to prevent and alleviate human suffering. Climate-related disasters such as heatwaves, floods, droughts and the diseases they encourage are sadly familiar enough, but we now face a global rise in these risks. Some of these rising risks are already locked in due to past emissions, and there is very limited time to prevent them from getting worse.
Climate change was initially seen as an environmental problem. Discussions centred on whether humans were causing it, and how much we would need to reduce emissions to avoid future problems. But more recently people have realized that humanitarian impacts are already happening: more intense monsoons and lethal heatwaves in Europe, for example, were wake-up calls on the changing risks. Right now, the world is fully aware of these rising risks, yet concerted international action to address them remains limited.

The 2015 Paris Agreement was an almost unprecedented international commitment to reduce emissions and address rising risks, especially for the most vulnerable. But the ambitions of Paris cannot be met by national governments alone; so private-sector CEOs are stepping up, cities are joining forces to create resilient futures, and communities around the world are taking action.

Such actions in the coming decade will help define the humanitarian landscape for this century. By 2030, we could be part of a world that is building resilience to rising risks while temperatures are kept to manageable levels; a world where the Red Cross Red Crescent plays a key role in connecting global ambition to local action. Or we could be part of a world that is locked in to unmanageable climate change, with existential challenges for small islands and low-lying coastal areas; heatwaves and other extremes that are beyond human coping capacity; entire ecosystems and many, many livelihoods under threat.

What is clear today is that we will need to radically change the way we work in order to meet the rising challenges of a changing climate issues that we will need to consider include these. ",,,
crisis and disasters,"The convergence, frequency and scale of increasing natural disasters, fragility, violence and conflict in the world is threatening efforts to end extreme poverty. Disasters are predicted to increase over the next decade as global temperatures climb and cause more frequent and intense weather events. While there are fewer large-scale interstate conflicts, other forms of conflict and violence have increased since 2010 and are prolonged with system wide implications.

Disasters and crisis are increasingly concentrated in complex settings. By 2030, almost half of the world’s poor are expected to live in countries affected by fragility, conflict and violence – mostly in Africa and the Middle East. As a result of the rate of urbanisation in Africa and Asia, we are seeing increasing disaster risks and violence in cities. As many as one in every three people living in cities will be in informal settlements within the period and will experience significant deprivation. Beyond traditional drivers of disasters and crisis, our increasing dependence on technology brings new risks and vulnerabilities including technological collapse, cyber and digital risks, ethics and digital vulnerability implications.

Our focus over the coming decade must be on mitigating the vulnerabilities and disadvantages resulting from all types of crisis and disasters for all people, especially the most vulnerable, so that all are able to thrive.

We will integrate disaster risk reduction and response programming across migration, climate change, food security, livelihoods, urban environments, health and digital vulnerabilities to ensure that we are working in an integrated manner, particularly in crisis and fragile contexts.

As a global network we will become better at anticipating and adapting to increasing and emerging risks, and work on stronger preventative measures. We will also expand approaches that promotes choice-enabling programming and actions as mechanisms that help communities decide for themselves what type of support they need within their contexts.  ","Disasters are predicted to become more common, more costly, more complex and, sadly,
more concentrated in populations least able to cope.
More common: Disasters due to extreme weather events and climate/environmental
disruptions to water and food supplies are predicted to increase. While there are now fewer
large-scale interstate conflicts, other forms of conflict and violence have increased since
2010. The complex geopolitical factors involved in these events often trigger humanitarian
crises that become protracted.
More costly: The world is rapidly urbanizing. Increasing population density in urban –
particularly informal – settings often experience significant deprivation. This means that
when disaster strikes – be it a seismic or weather related event or an infectious disease
outbreak – the impact on the population is high and rising and the ability to provide
immediate assistance low. Costs to lives and livelihoods are increasing.
More concentrated: Disaster and crises are significantly more frequent in fragile settings. By
2030 almost half of the world’s poor are expected to live in countries affected by fragility,
and conflict. Those least able to cope with disaster will be the most impacted.
More complex: Beyond traditional drivers of disaster and crises, our increasing dependence
on technology brings new risks and vulnerabilities including technological collapse as well as
other unexpected – and potentially unforeseen – cyber and digital threats.
Our focus over the coming decade will be on responding to and mitigating the
vulnerabilities and disadvantages resulting from all types of crises and disasters for all
people, especially the most vulnerable, so that they are able to thrive.
We will work to ensure that we can always be in the right place – effectively using
technology and innovation to anticipate risks and disasters and provide pro-active, early
action and predictive financing. 
9
We will work together to make sure that we have the right capacity – coordinating across
our regional and global network to ensure we have sufficient capacity to respond to the
increasing humanitarian demands, pooling resources and optimizing locally led
collaborations.
We will continue to develop the right skills – building the capabilities needed to respond to
our increasingly complex humanitarian environments: urban, protracted, virtual and
technological.
We will be there at the right time – investing before an event in disaster risk reduction and
climate adaptation, integrating these across all areas of our work.
We will insist on the right focus – placing affected people and communities at the centre of
preparedness and response, continually promoting ethical and people-led approaches such as
cash programming.","We are in a period of the globalisation of fragility. The definition of protection, its scope and limitations, the role of humanitarian agencies, authorities and other actors has been and continues to be debated. Within the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement, interpretations and practice on protection is also diverse and varied but the aspect is to explore it in a wide perspective around Do No Harm and keeping people safe, considering how National Societies (NS) have always engaged in wide range of protective actions, and in response to increasing conflict, displacement and migration, some are increasingly active in certain fields.
A cursory glance at the 2017 Global Peace Index (The 2017 Global Peace Index) makes for very interesting reading. Though it shows a slight improvement from 2016 due to gains in six of the nine geographical regions represented, the Index records a less peaceful world over the past decade. Since 2008, the global level of peace has deteriorated by 2.14%, with 80 countries improving while 83 countries deteriorated.

One of the major trends recorded over the last decade and attributed to this decline has been the growing inequality in peace between the most and least peaceful countries. These trends show that the growing inequality in peace is largely attributable to the rise of conflicts within states, the rise of terrorism and increasing levels of criminality. As desperate people flee conflict zones, the impact of forced displacement is hitting neighbouring countries hardest and they are coping as best they can.   The number of displaced people and refugees is the highest since the end of the Second World War. While the first half of the 20th century was a major period of inter-state warfare and wars of decolonisation, the second half gave way to an era of predominantly civil conflicts. A little over 20% of the world’s population live in countries under the threat of large-scale, organised violence, according to the World Bank’s 2011 World Development Report.

Experiences over the last decade in many parts of the world illustrate the challenges that the changing nature of armed conflict poses for peace as the landscape and nature of conflict change. Challenges to the established order in different places around the world are rising, linked to diverse causes – political change, regional and national autonomy, urbanisation, climate change, faith and cultural identity, or securing the basic conditions of life. Underlying some of the causes for current conflicts are some cross-cutting characteristics, including the rise of violent non-state actors and the prevalence of civil wars; deep socio-political and ethno-religious conflicts; huge levels of mistrust and intolerance; constantly changing alliances, loyalties and relationships; changing frontlines and territorial control; destruction of social infrastructures and services; and links to natural resources.

We are moving into a period of globalisation of fragility.  For all the relative calmness and progress of the second half of the 20th Century and the early years of the 21st, we still see a world that is hurting due to increased fragility – fragility that is globalising at the pace of our fast-evolving world.

Understanding how the different elements of risk interact with each other is fundamental to looking at the future of protection. The capacity to respond to challenges is necessary but not enough; and relying on crisis response is truly inadequate. It is essential to meet emerging problems upstream. We need to build systems that minimise risk and improve the human condition holistically.

As we look forward, we need to explore some key issues which raises questions around challenges for the concept of protection and the future of peace for the Red Cross and Red Crescent:

The scale and character of conflict is changing.  The distinctions between war and peace and who is a combatant and non-combatant are becoming uncomfortably blurred.  The battlefielf is both local and global. Modern conflict is hybrid in nature, combining traditional battlefield techniques with elements that were previously mostly associated with armed non-state actors. The Fourth Industrial Revolution offers individuals increasingly diverse ways to harm others on a grand scale such as cyber warfare / autonomous warfare. Current trends suggest a rapid and massive democratization of the capacity to inflict damage on a very large scale, challenging existing legal and ethical frameworks.  All of this raises questions around
What do we mean by peace? What is the definition of peace and what is a holistic version of this?
What do we mean by violent extremism and should we be dealing with it and if so what should our role be?
How can we work for conflict resolution and peaceful change in an era of renewed geopolitical division? Should we be playing a role?
What are the new ideas and initiatives on how to mediate conflict, but also in terms of fixing the relationships between the parties that stand behind those who are fighting?
How we remain true to an agenda that will transform people’s lives require supporting and working with those who work for peaceful change – in and out of government, in civil society, and including women and youth to help them:
call for peaceful change;
survive during conflict and maintain cohesion across conflict divides;
rebuild their lives and their institutions after the guns fall silent;
get involved fully and meaningfully in peace and reconciliation processes so that they can influence and live with the peace settlements that emerge.
This is a time of fundamental technological change. These rapid advances in technology are providing more than new capabilities – they are changing the way we live, work and relate to one another. The future (and the present) is digital: Humanitarian organizations are progressively becoming more digitally present, and able to leverage larger amounts of data from both offline and online groups of affected people.  What does this mean around protection and the future of peace? Do we need to talk about new norms and conventions that will protect civilian and affected community interests: a ‘Geneva Convention’ for the digital world which will be a critical first step to addressing a greater set of challenges around digital freedoms? In 2018, we’re only just beginning to understand how the digital revolution will alter the make-up of our societies and lives. We need to be asking ourselves what a free society looks like in a digital world and what forms our democratic rights take online. It’s no longer just our right to assemble peacefully offline that needs to be protected, it is also our right to assemble and mobilize online.

How can we learn how to build and develop trust with affected people, including in the digital space? Arguably, trust can only be achieved with some level of delivery, a degree of openness, transparency and a predisposition to learn. This includes more willingness from us to take criticism on board, reflect and act on it. However, what trust really means in the context of relationships between affected people and humanitarians, particularly in conflicts and situations of violence, remains poorly understood. Similarly, how it is to be built and developed, including in the digital space, is lacking. We need to examine and consider how to build “virtual proximity” and “digital trust” to complement our physical proximity.

How do we continue to ensure to build credibility and trust from the public that is fatigued by crises? How will we sustain operations in a large number of ignored or forgotten crises where human suffering may be at its greatest? If fragility and extreme poverty continue to concentrate in certain countries/regions, how do we better allocate our resources/efforts globally to support this? How do we structure and prepare our organisation, its people and skills for a scale up of activity to address needs in these contexts? How will RCRC manage complex cross-border responses with national organisational models? How will RCRC support displaced populations and those moving back to home countries with tailored and targeted support services that incorporate reintegration, livelihoods, health and education?

As the IFRC, we are not necessarily a peace building organisation or are mandated to work in conflict areas. As a membership organisation whose members are there before, during and after any crisis, we have a duty to work on building trust between communities and looking at the long-term provision of a culture of peace and non-violence. Within the IFRC, there is considerable experience illustrating clear and significant roles in preventing, mitigating and responding to interpersonal and self-directed violence. As the IFRC we are using this premise and experience to coalesce around the concept of protection in humanitarian action which is about keeping people safe from harm. 

 This changing protection landscape and the overall landscape around conflict raises the importance of protection (as a wide perspective) as part of IFRC’s action, and increased the need for clarity on the role and priorities of IFRC and its member National Societies in protection, especially as it relates to the work of ICRC and other specific protection-mandated organisations as well as the role in community violence prevention and in conflict.

To be prepared for the emerging future, the question is where can we situate the work of the IFRC and National Societies to identify and future current trends on protection-focused work of National Societies and support by the IFRC Secretariat, and situates those practices and approaches within the international standards and practice on protection?",,,
health,"Significant global health gains have been achieved in recent years. Major medical advances against killer diseases are continuously being achieved and new technologies offer greater regional and global infectious disease surveillance, to predict and prevent future infectious diseases threats.

However, people continue to face a complex mix of interconnected threats to their health and well-being. Infectious disease remains a major public health concern around the world. The changing health landscape and the threat multipliers of climate change on a global population that has changing demographics, aging and more dependant populations, face a higher rate of non-communicable disease and increased exposure to environmental pollution and toxins. Persistent threats also continue in ensuring safe access to water and safely managed sanitation and humanity is more at risk than ever of a global pandemic and epidemic. These issues collide with contexts where more than a billion people live in places where protracted crises and weak health services leave them without access to basic care and fostering environments where many other forgotten diseases emerge. Increasingly, mental health issues (in particular depression and anxiety disorders) rank highly in the global burden of disease, with social and digital isolation contributing to loneliness becoming a public health issue that is projected to reach epidemic proportions.

Most countries across the globe are facing a formidable challenge to manage the rapidly increasing cost of health care. A projected significant shortage of health workers – estimated to reach 18 million by 2030 – will affect the delivery of health services at all levels.

Our goal is that all citizens have safe, and equitable access to health, water, sanitation, and care services, in all countries. 

We will increase our work in community health and increase the number of Red Cross and Red Crescent community health workers, as well as supporting National Societies utilising their auxiliary role to deploy RCRC volunteers into health workforce strategies.

We will expand integrated health and care and water, sanitation and hygiene programmes to ‘last mile’ settings in order to meet the needs of vulnerable or marginalized groups in all countries where formal health systems are not able to meet the needs of their populations. We will also significantly invest in epidemic and pandemic preparedness.

We will work with partners to ensure that people have access the health care they need at a price they can afford.","Despite significant global health gains and major medical advances, people continue to face a
complex mix of interconnected risks to their health and well-being. Infectious diseases and
the risk of epidemics and pandemics are a major public global health concern. Health
landscapes are changing, as a result of climate change and increased exposure to
environmental pollution and toxins. Rates of non-communicable diseases continue to rise
throughout the world. Changing demographics means that more older people are becoming
dependent on health and social care services that often do not exist.
More than a billion people live in places where protracted crises and weak health services
leave them without access to basic care, fostering environments where forgotten diseases
emerge. An unacceptable amount of people still do not have access to clean water and basic
sanitation. 
10
Rising mental health issues such as depression and anxiety place increasing strain on
individuals, communities and health systems. Increasing rates of loneliness and digital
isolation are compounding already difficult situations.
Most countries across the globe are struggling to manage the rapidly increasing cost of health
care. A projected significant shortage of health workers – estimated to reach 18 million by
2030 – will affect the delivery of health services at all levels.
Our focus over the coming decade will be on making sure that all people have safe and
equitable access to health, water and sanitation.
We will expand our integrated community-based health, care and first aid as well as water,
sanitation and hygiene programmes in order to meet the unmet needs of vulnerable or
marginalised groups.
We will also significantly invest in epidemic and pandemic preparedness building trust,
ownership and engagement and placing communities at the centre of response.
We will enhance our work, through volunteers, campaigns and other efforts to build
community connections to promote positive mental health and wellbeing and reduce
loneliness as well as provide psycho-social support particularly in vulnerable communities
and those affected by conflict and disasters.
We will work with partners to improve access to affordable, quality health and social
cohension.","The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa dramatically raised awareness of the global burden of infectious disease and raised questions about the preparedness of public health systems. Infectious disease remains a major public health concern around the world, with more frequent emergence of epidemics and pandemics. Within the broader system, we witness the changing health landscape of a global population that is ageing and more vulnerable and has a higher rate of non-communicable disease and increased exposure to environmental pollution and toxins. Non-Communicable Diseases may be the global health crisis of the present and future, with a rapid expansion projected in middle and emerging economies. Persistent threats also continue with the challenges around ensuring safe access to water and sanitation, and the host of complications associated with these challenges, including Cholera. With cross-cutting issues of growing cities, the refocus on health systems in cities is becoming a primary concern.

At the same time, genetic research is demonstrating the clear potential for major medical advances in the coming years against such killer diseases as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, potentially saving millions of lives, especially in the developing world. Examples of this include genomic vaccines,  which are poised to make major inroads in medicine. They offer many advantages, including fast manufacture when a virus suddenly becomes more virulent or widespread. In addition, the emergence of disease surveillance systems has become vital for early identification of public health threats. A wealth of new technologies is increasingly becoming available. New methods are underway for regional and global infectious disease surveillance, with advances in epidemic modelling aimed at predicting and preventing future infectious diseases threats.


Most countries across the globe are facing a formidable challenge to manage the rapidly increasing cost of health care. Spending on health care in countries such as China and India will continue to rise in line with their economic growth, as they will in developed and other emerging economies with rapidly ageing populations. This will place significant strain on budgets, thereby requiring innovative social policy and potentially a greater reliance on civil society and voluntary organizations.

CONSIDERATIONS AND TENSION POINTS FOR THE RED CROSS AND RED CRESCENT
How can RCRC take advantage of new health innovation technology rapidly to change how we treat medical issues, and also how we better predict and prevent disease outbreak?
What changes to regional and global operating models and tools will be required of the Red Cross and Red Crescent to meet more effectively the needs of expanding or rapidly emerging health crises?
What role will National Societies have to play in their domestic arenas amidst a backdrop of rising health costs and challenges? Where will the financing and workforce come from to meet these needs?",,,
migration and identity,"The movement of people, whether voluntary or involuntary, is one of the defining features of the 21st century. Migration has helped improve people’s lives in both origin and destination countries and has offered millions of people worldwide to forge safe and meaningful lives.

The number of migrants globally has grown since 2000 alongside global population growth, and in some part of the developing world, is overtaking fertility as a main driver of population growth. This is projected to keep increasing as rising instances of conflict and poverty, a lack of quality employment opportunities and climate change redraws the map of where people can live.

Migration is a concern for us because of the increasing risks that people face when they are on the move. These risks include exploitation and abuse at the hands of traffickers and other criminal groups, as well deprivations that are caused by policies that limit access to basic services and care. These journeys are particularly difficult for stateless people and those who do not have official proof of identity.

There are underlying tensions that migration is increasingly challenging the conventional definitions of citizenship, and identity. It is being used in some countries to fuel tension and even xenophobia. It has been blamed for economic and social marginalisation and has been instrumental in political debates and elections.  This is often accompanied – in migrants and host communities alike – by stress and worries about identity, about the changing fabric and make up of societies, and what it means to ‘belong’.

We want all people who migrate, to be safe, be treated humanely and with dignity. We want all people to have the support they need to thrive in inclusive societies.

Strategy 2030 envisages the expansion and integration of migration and inclusion programming and services across all service areas. We will expand our support to migrants at all points along major migratory routes. This includes scaling up our work to foster and promote inclusion and social cohesion, recognizing that these issues are interlinked to the wellbeing and flourishing of all people both in home and host communities. We will pay particular attention to the links between climate change and migration, recognising that the coming decade will likely see millions of people leave their homes because of changing weather.

We will improve how we work across borders, allowing for more connected programmes between countries, National Societies and along migration routes.

We will strive to ensure that our programming is reflective of the societies we live in and expand the diversity and inclusion in our staff and volunteers. We will speak up to influence global, regional and domestic policy and advocacy dialogue for a more inclusive world.","The movement of people, whether voluntary or involuntary, is one of the defining features of
the 21st century. The number of migrants globally has grown significantly since 2000 and is
projected to keep rising as a result of conflict, poverty and a lack of quality employment
opportunities. Climate and envionemental crises will make some regions uninhabitable,
forcing people to move en masse. 
11
The risks that people face when they are on the move are growing. These include exploitation
and abuse at the hands of traffickers and other criminal groups, as well deprivations caused
by policies that limit access to basic services and care. The risks are heightened for stateless
people and those who do not have official proof of identity.
Migration has helped improve people’s lives in both origin and destination countries and has
allowed millions of people around the world to build safe and meaningful lives. However,
migration in some parts of the world is currently being used as an instrument to fuelling
tension and xenophobia. This is often accompanied – in migrant and host communities alike
– by stress and worries about acceptance, identity and what it means to ‘belong’. The
convergence of these diverse issues is rapidly changing the fabric of societies around the
world.
Our focus over the coming decade will be on making sure that all people who migrate
are safe, and are treated humanely and with dignity, and ensuring that all people have
the support they need to thrive in inclusive societies.
We will expand our support to migrants at all points along major migratory routes.
We will ensure a strong focus on promoting protection for vulnerable groups, women,
children, people with disabilities and asylum seekers. We will scale up our work on inclusion
and social cohesion.
We will invest in research and new transformative partnerships that can help us to better
meet evolving profiles and needs of people on the move.
We will improve how we work across borders, allowing for more connected programmes
and information systems between countries, National Societies, and along migration routes. ","The make-up of our society is rapidly changing. Decades of technological advancement and global integration of trade have seen millions lifted out of poverty and a rapidly expanding middle class, especially in Asia. By 2020, a majority of the world’s population will live in middle-class or rich households for the first time ever, and by 2030, this number will exceed 5 billion people. However, the benefits of economic and technological change have not been equally shared and the pace of change has left political, regulatory and welfare systems unable to cope, fostering division and aggravating grievances. Since the Global Financial Crisis, the middle class has been hollowed out in many advanced and some emerging economies, with incomes stagnating or even declining.  Meanwhile, the richest 1% accumulated more wealth than the rest of the world put together. Alongside this backdrop is a growing number of migrants and displaced people that create more fluid, mobile and diverse communities with distinct, and sometime divergent, worldviews.
Much of the population movement reinforces the trend of urbanization. As many as 1 in 3 people living in cities will be in informal settlements within the S2030 period and will experience significant deprivation, particularly in Africa where this growth is projected to be the most pronounced and the most severe. For many National Societies, the defining issue of their relevance will be in how well they engage with and support the needs of those communities living in urban informal settlements.


The complex confluences of diverse issues including increasing migration (forced and voluntary), social and physical mobility, the inexorable growth and complexity of cities, the youth bulge in developing countries and an ageing population in developed and middle-income countries, the evolution of online tools and connectivity – are fast changing the fabric of societies and driving the (trans)formation of communities. Threaded through these complex changes, individuals are engaging with each other and with institutions differently, creating spaces for emergent community groups as well as virtual ones. A democratization of voice from previously marginalised or minority groups and a need for self-identity, agency and presence in decision-making are conflicting with traditional, mainstream ideologies and established political order. The impacts of these changes are being seen every day across a range of issues – be it raised awareness on LGBTQI, gender relations, race relations and youth voice issues amongst others. In many pockets, civil society is pushing back against the status quo, refusing to be spoken for and demanding change from both governments and institutions. How we think about the make-up of communities, and the assumptions that underpin this, is being challenged in this shifting landscape.
CONSIDERATIONS AND TENSION POINTS FOR THE RED CROSS AND RED CRESCENT
Are National Societies reflective of the diversity of the contemporary societies they live in? How do we ensure that our programs are representative of all different groups?
How will National Societies engage with communities when the very nature of community is changing? How will we strengthen our engagement and mobilisation with communities connected through digital technologies, that are flatter, more dynamic and distributed networks?
How do we engage with increasingly fluid and internationally mobile/connected communities while our structures favour national fortressing, and struggle with disconnection, rigidity and lacking data and operational integration?
WHAT ARE THE POSSIBILITIES?
The RCRC brand, if trusted and consistent across borders, could allow for seamless engagement with mobile communities.  New technologies could ensure more integration of data and effort transnationally. For instance, a migrant passing through a number of countries on their way to their destination should have their information and needs integrated across our systems, so they do not have to re-tell their story at every stage and can have their personalised needs addressed. The RCRC is strongly integrated into communities and can use this to adapt to and build on efforts to engage with new communities. Amendments to our structures and approaches will be necessary, but if there is enough leadership commitment this can be achieved.",,,
"values, power and inclusion","Values-based tensions are manifesting in different ways in different places, creating new fault lines within and between countries, regions and communities. The benefits of economic and technological progress are not being equally shared, and the pace of change is leaving many political, regulatory and welfare systems unable to cope, fostering division and aggravating grievances. The implications of globalisation and increasing inequality is fuelling a push back on elitism, but also fanning populism, nationalism, and cultural and religious clashes.

Many previously marginalised voices are now demanding that they are present for and involved in decision-making. In some countries, efforts to secure recognition and equality for a widening range of social groups – defined by characteristics such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity or sexual orientation – are now influencing elections.

The consequences of these changes are being seen every day across a range of issues. Much-loved and well-known institutions are being challenged as expectations change, accountability is demanded, and trust is no longer a given. In many places, the space for civil society is shrinking, with people and communities refusing to be spoken for and demanding change from both governments and institutions. Multilateralism is under increasing strain. At the same time, many governments are asserting sovereignty or even rejecting the involvement of outside organizations in domestic affairs.  Local-led responses to disasters and crisis will increasingly drive international response in the coming decade.

Values are increasingly seen to be a source of division rather than unity, not just globally but also within regions and countries.

At their worst, these transformations risk giving rise to a more disconnected, less humane, less empathetic world. These issues illustrate an unapologetic subordination of human lives to other gains – an anti-humanitarianism. We see this playing out in the politicization of humanitarian crises, making it increasingly difficult for neutral and impartial aid agencies to operate independently.

We want to promote inclusive and fair humanitarian values that encourage a positive, hopeful change for humanity.

Expanded humanitarian education programmes will focus on combating rising anti-humanitarianism, xenophobia and polarisation, as well as improving access for people whose education has been disrupted by war, disaster or displacement. Our education programmes will also prepare people for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.

We will consciously invest in shifting power structures in all spaces – communities, institutions, and our own network. At the same time, our work in diversity and inclusion will expand, particularly in our work and support of women and girls. We will recognise the impact gender inequalities have on people’s ability to thrive and increase our support for women’s leadership across all levels of our organisations.","Values-based tensions are manifesting in different ways in different places, creating new fault
lines within and between countries, regions and communities. The pace of change is leaving
many political, regulatory and welfare systems unable to cope. The benefits of economic and
technological progress are not equally shared. Multilateralism is under increasing strain.
Increasing inequalities in a globalized world challenge elitism, and are contributing to
populism, nationalism, and cultural and religious clashes.
Space for principled humanitarian action is shrinking – and even criminalised in some parts
of the world.
These global changes risk creating a more disconnected, less humane and less empathetic
world.
But there are also many people the world over want to make their lives, their community and
their world better.
Many previously marginalised voices are now calling for greater agency and involvement in
decision-making. In many countries, there are influential efforts to secure recognition, rights
and equality for all regardless of sex, race, ethnicity, religion, gender or sexual orientation.
The role of well-known institutions is being challenged and people are refusing to be spoken
for. They are less willing to accept the ‘status quo’ and are demanding greater accountability
and transparency.
Gender analysis reveals gaps and disparities in wellbeing, roles, power and access to
resources. A call for diversity and true equal inclusion of women is driving change across
civil society, institutions and government structure and policy particularly in areas of
protection, leadership and decision making.
Our continued focus over the coming decade will be on protecting and promoting a
positive change for humanity and on humanitarian values and principles.

We will expand out humanitarian education programmes focusing on values, a culture of
peace and inclusion, as well as improving access for people whose education has been
disrupted by war, disaster or displacement. Our education programmes will also prepare
people for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.
We will focus on initiatives that help foster and promote our Fundamental Principles. But
we also recognise that times are shifting and in addition to these Principles, there others that
are central to our work including sustainability, equality and inclusion, and the agency of
local communities to lead their own change.
We will focus on initiatives that promote inclusion and diversity in opportunities,
represe+C18ntation and decision making, both within our own organizations and network as well
as in society at large.
We will expand our work in diversity and inclusion, to be more intersectional, particularly in
our work and support of women, girls and different gender identities. We will work to
increase our support and focus of women’s leadership across all levels of our organization.","The past decade has shown the fragility and inability of today’s global governance mechanisms, an interlocking system of competing sovereign states, international organizations like the UN, and non-state NGOs and corporations, to address adequately world issues such as climate change and environmental degradation. Many have observed that the scale and capacity of nation-states is insufficient for the problems facing the increasingly globalized world today, too big for local accountability and too small to deal with issues requiring global intervention. At the same time, forms of cross-border governance are changing and increasing in strength and effectiveness (the Chinese One Belt One Road Initiative, ASEAN, and the rise of regional free trade areas in West and East Africa are examples).

The private sector is also increasing in power and influence, potentially driving a trend for alternative forms of governance, with many companies wielding more influence on global issues than most countries, most recently recognized by the Danish Government appointing an ambassador to Silicon Valley. A few international humanitarian organizations have followed suit, with Amnesty International and UNICEF appointing representatives to the Silicon Valley to engage for influence and partnerships. The private sector, responding to an increasing consumer social consciousness, has also invested in areas of social impact that are usually seen as a ‘public responsibility’, and taken on increased roles in delivering humanitarian and development aid, further questioning the governance roles played by nation states and humanitarian organizations.

 


Increasingly, cities are also asserting their geopolitical power on the world stage, with megacities becoming powerful influencers by themselves. Greater city-level governance and pan-city networks have gained wider acceptance as another model of global governance. This view holds that cities are re-emerging as political forces on the world stage, able to address problems more nimbly at the local level and to network across national boundaries to face global challenges. Foreign direct investment is being injected into cities of emerging markets as the confluence of urbanization and a large youth workforce are seen as attractive investments.

Amongst the mosaic of newly forming pockets of power and influence, is the reality that trust in global institutions (including government and humanitarian organizations) is at an all-time low. The 2017 Edelman Trust Barometer paints a picture of a broken global system with little hope for things to improve. Humanitarian organizations are caught in this web of distrust – a long way from 2001 when they were considered a rising influence. 53% of global respondents showed trust in humanitarian organizations, a large decline from a peak of 66% trust in 2014. In the last year alone, high profile scandals involving corruption and sexual abuse have only heightened these levels of distrust, with the public and donors calling for new accountability measures and investigations.

This backdrop is contributing to fueling a rise of social movements and fringe groups, pushing back against issues of power and elitism. Enduring economic stagnation and increasing mistrust of politics are driving populism, nationalism, and cultural and religious clashes. It is indicative of increasing skepticism in government and bureaucracy among many democracies and youth especially. It would be a mistake however to overestimate the recent surge in nationalistic sentiment across Europe and North America, as deteriorating global crises and time itself may yet provide conditions for greater institutional enforcement and legal structures at the global level. At the same time, national governments in the global south are taking more assertive roles and questioning foreign involvement in domestic affairs.

If the trend toward heightened nationalism continues amidst a declining relevance of global governance (including declining significance of UN systems) and slow or non-existent intervention from global powers in crises, we could see national crises spiral significantly, or remain ignored or forgotten. Furthermore, restrictions to the delivery of aid from international organizations by states suspicious of foreign intervention, and their own gaps in domestic regulation and procedures necessary to manage outside aid, may exacerbate crises and lead to gaps in the coverage of needs.

CONSIDERATIONS AND TENSION POINTS FOR THE RED CROSS AND RED CRESCENT
As expectations change about how governments relate to their citizens, how are perceptions of National Societies – and of their auxiliary role – likely to change?
How does the IFRC network engage with local governments and the private sector to develop new approaches to addressing humanitarian and development need? Are our efforts at advocacy, representation and partnerships reflective of shifting power structures?
Are the structures of the IFRC member network and decision-making processes in line with broader social and political shifts? Are financial and organizational structures previously established to serve north to south flows suited to the shifting dynamics of global power and influence?
How will RCRC engage with governance mechanisms and structures to ensure that support continues for low profile crises?
With issues of credibility and trust deepening, how should the Secretariat and National Societies continue to build trust within this complex backdrop of significantly different constituencies – communities, donors, partners?

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBILITIES?
The auxiliary role affords National Societies the opportunity to remain close to national governments.  However, our trusted brand and unparalleled scale also affords access to the major private sector players and provides an opportunity to ‘bend the trillions’ in addition to ‘spending the billions’, if that trust can be maintained. An extensive infrastructure through the branch network ensures a foundation through which both citizen/community level and city level engagement can fruitfully deepen, but will require new models and thinking. The global network and representation through the IFRC and member National Societies gives the organization the potential to influence global forces while mobilizing effectively around a localization agenda.",,,
