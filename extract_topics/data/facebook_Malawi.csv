Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) with funding from European Union Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO) is implementing an 18 months Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) program with the aim of building resilience to communities in Malawi to enable them reduce the risks of disasters. 

Chikwawa, Phalombe Nsanje and Thyolo are the targeted districts. These four districts are among the 15 districts that are prone to flooding.  

Apart from many activities and initiatives, the project engages the school pupils and communities to disseminate early waning and other DRR messages through drama performances.

According to the ECHO DRR Project Manager Roster Kufandiko, the use of dram and songs has proved to be an effective tool of disseminating DRR messages as this has raised awareness within vulnerable communities in disaster prone areas of the possible dangers of natural disasters. Kufandiko said that the dramas are participatory in nature where by the drama is paused in the middle of the play and allow members of the audience to substitute actors and take up the role of the actor. “This makes the audience follow every word and in turn get all the information.”  Kufandiko said.

On mitigation measures to flooding, among others, MRCS through the project has installed River Gages on almost all the rivers that pose threats to the communities. 

The MRCS ECHO DRR project interventions have already proved to be a success as evidenced by the much acquired knowledge on reading early warning signs and the level of awareness on general Disaster Risk Reduction issues among the target population."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1183164195148678/|4.0|||photo|2017-07-08T11:57:04+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

The Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) has handed over a one million Euros (about K560 million) worth Diarrhoea Mitigation Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) project which it was implementing in the area of Traditional Authority (T/A) Mkhumba in Phalombe.

Speaking at the handover ceremony on Tuesday, MRCS Deputy President Mary Ngulube said implementation of the three-year long project was influenced by the high mortality and morbidity rate which Phalombe was registering mostly due to diarrhoeal disease. The dirrhoeal disease cases were mainly caused by unsafe water which people in the district were using.

“Realising that it is painful to lose a child to an easily prevented or cured ailment such as diarrhoea, Malawi Red Cross Society, the Government of Malawi and other stakeholders, with financial support from the Netherlands Red Cross, came together to embark on this project.

“The project’s water and sanitation facilities were handled over to the communities so that they can run them on their own. As we are doing this, we urge communities to take care of the facilities so that they should also benefit generations to come,” said Ngulube.

Ngulube said the project mainly focused on four areas namely provision of improved water sources; promotion of hygiene and sanitation services; provision of diarrhoea drugs for early treatment and capacity building for the benefiting communities.
“Through the provision of improved water sources, the project rehabilitated and upgraded Phalombe Minor Gravity Water fed system to support about 20 communities. It also rehabilitated 45 boreholes and provided 2 200 water filters to some households and schools who still had no access to safe water sources.
“Also, on promotion of hygiene and sanitation, we constructed 80 latrines in eight schools, pit-emptied and repaired 20 latrines in two primary schools. We also constructed 20 urinals and 20 hand washing facilities for boys and girls in the same schools as well as eight latrines at Mpasa and Migowi health centres,” added Ngulube.

Phalombe District Commissioner (DC) Harry Phiri, speaking in an interview, commended Malawi Red Cross Society by saying that the project has brought a number of fruits since its inception.

Phiri cited how cases of waterborne diseases have gone down in the district, how women and girls are no longer travelling long distances to fetch water leaving their farms and homes unattended and how hygiene has improved in health centres and schools in the district.

“The improved water supply is also helping at Migowi Health Centre where previously pregnant women and their guardians had to walk long distances in order to fetch water. Hygiene activities at the health centre have also been uplifted because of the provision of water. Washing of bed linen has also been simplified,” said Phiri.

Guest of honor at the handover ceremony, Southern Region irrigation and water development officer Phideria Moyo also commended MRCS and Netherlands Red Cross for the project.
She said though Phalombe is naturally blessed with water; it was a problem for communities to access clean and potable water because the available water is not clean and unsafe for drinking.

“This project also came at a time when Malawi as a country and government is racing towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 which is to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.
In her remarks, T/A Mkhumba said the project has simplified her people’s lives. She said now people can access safe and potable water right in their communities.

“Before this project, my subjects had to walk long distances to source for water which was usually not potable and was causing waterborne diseases. We are happy about this project and its benefits,” said the chief.

All the communities benefitting from the project also shared their chief's excitement by thanking Malawi Red Cross Society and Netherlands Red Cross."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1170761356388962/|4.0|||photo|2017-06-24T15:22:26+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

After 34 months of implementation of 1.7 Million worthy Integrated WASH intervention in low income areas of Mzuzu and Karonga Project, in partnership with the Netherlands Red Cross with Financial support from the European Union (EU), Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) on Tuesday  celebrated its achievements and officially handed over the WASH facilities of the project to Karonga District Council and Mzuzu City Council. 

According to Hastings Kandaya, Acting Secretary General of MRCS, the project had four areas of focus among others, to improve Sanitation Coverage and Improve access to potable water to Mzuzu and Karonga residents where the project managed to construct 20 community water kiosks and rehabilitated 25 others in Mzuzu and Karonga. 

“On improving sanitation coverage the project managed to increase the latrine coverage in the project areas with special consideration for people with physical disabilities and girls undergoing menstruation. During the implementation period, the project managed to construct 100 improved latrines and dislodged (pit emptied) 575 filled up latrines in health centers and schools. Further, the project rehabilitated a total of 25 public owned latrines which were dilapidated and unusable. All the 675 latrines are now in use. Random visits to primary schools in Mzizu and Karonga show that absenteeism of girls in schools has reduced due to improved privacy as the new latrines provide change rooms for girls during menstruation.” Kandaya said.

Kandaya further applauded and attributed the success of the project to the coordination that existed among the partners namely Northern Region Water Board, Mzuzu University, Mzuzu City Council, Karonga District council and the EU.

In an effort to further improve and sustain latrine coverage in the impact areas, the project through its partner, Mzuzu University established five demonstration centers with three different latrine designs at each center for people to emulate from for good and permanent latrine structures."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1166251466839951/|4.0|||photo|2017-06-15T20:16:00+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) has urged all parents and caregivers in the country to take their children for Measles Rubella vaccination during the week-long vaccination campaign which will start on Monday, June 12 to Friday, June 16, 2017.

MRCS, in the mobilisation exercise, has brought together almost 2 600 of its volunteers who are conducting door to door visits in all the locations of six districts namely Blantyre, Zomba, Mangochi, Lilongwe, Mzuzu and Mzimba. It is being conducted with financial support from American Red Cross.

Taonga Nyekanyeka, MRCS programmes manager, who is also focal person for the mobilisation campaign, speaking in an interview in Chilomoni Township in Blantyre today where some volunteers were conducting the door to door mobilisation, said the door to door strategy is ideal as the volunteers are providing informed viewpoints about Measles Rubella vaccination to parents and caregivers.

He added that the strategy, to run for 10 days up to the last day of the vaccination period, also gives the parents and caregivers an opportunity to get answers to their unresolved questions or concerns that other channels do not answer.

 “Volunteers are visiting households to sensitize parents and caregivers regarding measles control and the need for parents and caregivers to take their children for the measles rubella vaccination campaign.

“The volunteers are also making a count of targeted children in a household to inform accurate planning and measurement of vaccination coverage at the end of the campaign,” said Nyekanyeka.

American Red Cross measles rubella advisor Amina Ismail, in interview, said rubella is a big issue and globally, the disease occurs under measles. She added that, as such, many countries in the globe have introduced the Measles Rubella vaccine as one component.

“In Africa, we have several countries who have introduced the vaccine together with the measles vaccine. For Malawi to come into the scene, it just shows that it is moving on with the rest of the globe to ensure that its children and mothers are protected against this preventable disease,” said Ismail.

According to one of the volunteers, Sheriffa Bakali, most of the households being visited in the locations have an idea about the Measles Rubella campaign. They have heard the messages on radios, community gatherings and some even at funerals.

“When visiting the households, we are just adding on to the information which they already have. From the households, we are gathering information regarding how many children aged nine months to 15 years are there and also encouraging them to take these children to get the vaccination,” said Bakali.

The vaccination campaign, to take place in all public and Christian Hospital Association of Malawi (Cham) facilities and other designated sites, will see a combined measles and rubella (MR) vaccine being administered to children from nine months old to less than 15 years old.

De-worming tablets will be administered to children aged a year-old to less than five years while a vitamin A capsule will be supplemented to children aged from six months to less than five years.

The Ministry of Health (MoH) has organised the measles rubella vaccination campaign to ensure adequate protection of children against measles and rubella diseases; intestinal worms and vitamin A deficiency conditions.

After the campaign, from July 2017, MoH will introduce the measles and rubella vaccine into the routine immunization schedule for children. The children will be given two doses of the combined measles and rubella vaccine to replace the two doses of measles vaccine. The vaccine will continue to be given to children from nine to 15 months of age. About 8 million children are expected to receive the vaccine during the campaign."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1161829583948806/|7.0|||photo|2017-06-10T19:46:05+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

About 22 suspected cholera cases were received at Montfort Mission Hospital in Nchalo, Chikwawa from 23rd May.  According to the Environmental Health Officer (EHO) at the hospital, Ms. Matilda Mkhambule, the number of cases escalated rapidly from two cases received on 23rd May to 22 cases to date.

Mkhambule attributed the possible cause to Poor hygiene in some households and the use of unsafe water from Mkombezi river which run through most of the affected areas such as Allan Village which registered a total of 6 cases, Sekeni village which registered 8 cases, Dzilonzo  village which registered 3 cases, Nyaka, Hetala and Sanyama villages with 1 case each.

Mkhambule thanked Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) and UNICEF for being the first organizations to come in with support. However she highlighted some gaps such as inadequate of blankets, Gumboots, aprons, cannulas, Water guard, ORS, washing powder, Water and spirit.

MRCS’s National Disaster Response Team (NDRT) trained Cecilia Banda who is the District Project Officer for Chikwawa said that after conducting a rapid assessment MRCS came in to support by providing infection prevention items such as gloves and gumboots. In addition, MRCS has erected tents for administering ORS, cleaned the surrounding of the treatment center and constructed a pit latrine, among other things.

“Our volunteers have been mobilized and have been deployed to the affected villages to provide door to door hygiene promotion messages and assist with the administering of ORS.” Banda said.

This year, cholera cases started emerging in March with cases coming from Mozambique through bordering districts of Nsanje, Mwanza and Chikwawa. 

A visit to Thendo Cholera Treatment Camp under Dolo Heath Centre in the area of Traditional Authority Masache, 58 Kms away from Nchalo, revealed that about 20 cases were seen at the camp from 8th of April. MRCS’S Thendo Sub Division Chairman, Andrew Dazimata said that all the 20 cases that were treated at the camp were from Manunkha area in Mozambique. 

MRCS has also supported Gaga in Chikwawa and Ndamera Health Centers in Nsanje with the construction of temporally latrines and Bathroom shelters among others.

With displaced numbers growing, the IFRC appeals for 2.6 million Swiss francs to support Malawi Red Cross emergency operations

Lilongwe, 26 January 2015: With more rain expected in flood-stricken Malawi and camps for displaced people overwhelmed, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has launched an emergency appeal for 2.6 million Swiss francs to help 42,000 desperate people.

The appeal will support emergency operations of the Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) which is already aiding thousands of destitute people in the worst-affected southern districts of Nsanje, Chikwawa, Phalombe and urban Blantyre. They will target the immediate needs of 7,660 households for nine months.
MRCS Secretary General Ethel Kaimila said today, “Our task right now is to ensure that people survive and to alleviate the appalling conditions so many are in. We must feed them, shelter them, ensure they have safe water and sanitation, and deal with the growing threat to their health. And when that is done we must help them to recover and resettle.”
Heavy rains have ceased for now but are forecast to return and could continue for weeks. “The chance of more flooding remains high,” said Michael Charles, IFRC’s acting regional representative in southern Africa. “A dire situation could be exacerbated. Things could go from bad to worse.” 
Figures of how many people have been displaced still need to be verified but estimates suggest at least 174,000. The government estimates that in total 630,000 people have been affected. MRCS volunteers in displaced locations report that numbers are certainly growing as sodden houses collapse and more people emerge from the devastation.
Grossly inadequate shelter in the improvised camps to which people have fled, and the risk of epidemic disease, are major Red Cross concerns. With sources of water contaminated and sanitation poor, there is mounting fear of water-related sickness, and cholera is endemic. Malaria can be expected to spread with stands of stagnant water providing mosquitoes with breeding grounds. 
Secretary General Kaimila says in one camp of 2,500 people she found 40 or 50 people sheltered in tents meant for no more than ten. Food distribution was intermittent and those 2,500 people had access to just four latrines. The camps are overcrowded and overwhelmed.
The appeal seeks to fund operations providing food and shelter, safe water and sanitation, and health and care services. Red Cross volunteers would also reunite families the floods have separated. Across the devastated south, people lost sight of loved ones in the chaos of evacuation, and children now on their own in the makeshift camps is a Red Cross priority.
The planned response reflects the current situation and will be adjusted in the light of new developments and more detailed assessments now being conducted by an IFRC Field Assessment Coordination Team (FACT).

Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) and the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) have jointly launched the Floods response operation for the return of Internary Displaced Persons (IDPs).

Speaking on Saturday at Thundu Camp in Chikwawa District, Minister of Homeland Security Nicholas Dausi commended Malawi Red Cross for tirelessly supporting the Floods survivors. Dausi thanked MRCS for coming up with a full return package that will enable the IDPS leave the camps and return home and reconstruct houses on the higher areas.

MRCS President Levison Changole said Malawi Red Cross is very committed to see that the IDPs leave the camps as soon as possible and go back to build better houses that are resilient to Disasters such as Floods and strong winds. He said that the joint response operation has targeted 14,000 households in the five districts of Chikwawa, Phalombe, Mulanje, Nsanje and Zomba.

Within the return package MRCS will distribute Tarpaulins, Sleeping Mats, Kitchen sets, Buckets, tablets of Soap, Shelter tool kit, Chlorine and ORS and dignity kit, while DODMA will distribute Maize (50kg bags), Blankets, Soya Pieces, Beans, Mosquito nets, Cooking Oil and seed.

Changole thanked DFID, EU-ECHO, WFP, UNICEF, International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), Danish, Swiss, Netherlands and Belgian Red Cross Societies and Local partners that include Toyota Malawi, NBS Banks, John Hopkins Research Project Malawi and Minet Insurance company for the support.

Apart from the Non Food Items that MRCS is distributing, MRCS is constructing 170 Transitional Shelters in the three districts of Chikwawa, Phalombe and Nsanje.

Speaking after touring the Transitional Shelters MRCS has constructed at Mwalija village, Minister Dausi said the initiative is very good. He appealed to other organizations to emulate the gesture the Malawi Red Cross has demonstrated.

Paramount Chief Lund of Chikwawa advised his subjects to leave the camp once they receive the items. He warned them not to sell the items received but to put them to good use.

Meanwhile the Malawi Red Cross Society has launched an appeal with the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies that focus on WASH, Shelter and Livelihood."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1661364623995297/|11.0|||photo|2019-04-29T07:19:24+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Needs $2.7million to help more people over the next two months

Lilongwe, MALAWI, 20 January 2015 - The Malawi Red Cross is continuing to support people affected by floods which have left 135,000 displaced in three districts of southern Malawi. Rainstorms have also destroyed houses and property in the capital Lilongwe and the commercial city of Blantyre where some people were killed by the rising waters. 

Heavy rains have, over the past weeks, caused flooding in Malawi especially the southern districts of Phalombe, Nsanje and Chikwawa, leaving close to 200 people dead.

Working through our local volunteers, we have been responding to the disaster and helping victims in all the affected areas, said Ethel Kaimila, Secretary General of the Malawi Red Cross Society. Apart from general response operations, the Red Cross has directly supported 7,000 displaced people with tarpaulins, family tents, shelter kits, mosquito nets and hospital tents.

The Red Cross, with support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, plans to assist 40,000 affected people in Chikwawa, Nsanje, Phalombe and some urban parts of the city of Blantyre between February and March. The affected people will need continued support for some time and we need 2.7 million US dollars to provide such support between, added Kaimila. Funds raised will be used to distribute additional emergency relief supplies such as kitchen sets, shelter kits and tarpaulins; food supplies to support displaced families for three months, and to rehabilitate 600 houses damaged by the floods.

Apart from our own response, we have also provided tarpaulins, blankets and body bags to the Government of Malawi for use in their response. 

Since the first day of the disaster, the Red Cross has been providing a number of services to the affected including managing camps, reconnecting separated families, assisting in search and rescue operations, counselling flood victims, and distributing relief items.

Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) last week organized National Disaster Response Team (NDRT) training in Chikwawa to improve preparedness and response before, during and after disasters.

About 27 volunteers and staff took part in the training whose aim was to build the capacity of National Societies’ staff and volunteers, according to MRCS Head of Health Programs Mrs. Gloria Kunyenga.

Speaking during the opening of the training, Mrs. Kunyenga said the NDRT training was to give all components of the Movement the means to work together in a coordinated manner. 

“The focus of NDRT training is generally on improving the technical skills of the participants, but also on personnel and team management. It aims to encourage an exchange of experience and knowledge and the creation of networks among the disaster managers. It also aims to improve coordination of disaster response and the quality and availability of disaster management tools,” Kunyenga said.

National Disaster Response Teams comprise of National Society staff and volunteers, often from different branches trained and working alongside Red Cross volunteers at community level to bring assistance to people affected by disaster. 

They are made up of generalists and specialists in health, logistics, relief, disaster management and water and sanitation. NDRT can be mobilised at short notice and are trained to work as a team and support the local Red Cross branch in its response to disasters.

Community Resilience Project funded the training with financial support from a consortium of Danish Red Cross, Finish Red Cross, Icelandic Red Cross and Italian Red Cross. 

In country Danish Red Cross delegate and consortium coordinator Kirstine Primdal urged participants to take the training seriously so that MRCS should have a strong NDRT."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1067996633332102/|10.0|||photo|2017-02-04T19:16:58+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Changole added that it would be pleasing for the amended document to fill in visible constitutional gaps and polish some grey areas that seemed confusing and contradictory in nature.

The Legal adviser for MRCS Mr. Titus Mvalo SC pointed out that though the constitution provided room for amendment it was important for members to seriously look at the clauses to be amended. He underscored a fact that a constitution is a legal document as such it must be respected at all times despite taking part in the review process. Mr Mvalo reminded members that the constitution which the MRCS is using was last amended in 2007 and it was inevitable to have it revised to meet the current needs. Mr. Mvalo added that a series of consultative meetings are expected to to take place before the final recommendations are presented to the council for adoption.

Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) has managed to transform communities in Mzimba and Salima districts into becoming places with access to improved & sustainable water sources and improved sanitation and hygiene.

This has been achieved through the Integrated Community Based Health Care Project funded by the Swiss Red Cross.
The project is being implemented in 115 villages and 15 institutions in Traditional Authority Kampingo Sibande in Mzimba and in 161 villages and 10 institutions in Traditional Authority Khombedza in Salima. 

On top of constructing toilets in schools the project also advocated for the construction of toilets at household level without external subsidy.

Tadeyo Chakwira Village is one model village which has achieved increased access to improved & sustainable water source and sanitation and hygiene. 

Happy Muva who is a volunteer for the area said the whole village which has 45 households and over 150 people used to have 18 toilets, but now the village has 100% toilet coverage with some households having more than one toilet.

“We used to have a lot of diarrhoea problems because most of us were using the bush to relieve ourselves. But through this project where we are working through the chiefs we have managed to convince each household to have a toilet and a hand wash facility which is used to wash hands after using the toilet. We all now know the dangers of not having a toilet. For example diarrhoea used to be number one killer of under five children in our area, but now there are no new registered cases.” Added Muva

Speaking on Friday during the commemoration of 2016 World Toilet Day in Tadeyo Chakwira village in Mzimba where 33 villages were declared open defecation free (ODF) by the Mbelwa District Council, Secretary General for MRCS, Mrs. Ethel Kaimila Namaliya, said that she was happy to see that the project had improved the health status of the people. Namaliya attributed the success to the good coordination and collaboration among all the stakeholders.

To improve the water situation the project drilled 20 new boreholes and rehabilitated 6 in Mzimba and drilled 6 new boreholes and rehabilitated 15 in Salima."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1012003265598106/|5.0|||photo|2016-11-19T19:30:02+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

13TH SEPTEMBER 2014
Malawi joined the rest of the World in commemorating World First Aid Day on 13th September2014. The function was held at Lirangwe Community Day Secondary School Ground in Blantyre. Theme for the Day was ‘First Aid and Daily or Disaster Risk’. 
Malawi Red Cross and other First Aid Players in the country; St John’s Ambulance and MASM cerebrated the day in style by passing across messages to the Nation on the importance of First Aid in one’s daily life; thus at school, on the road, at home and even at work place.
As the theme highlighted, Disasters whether big or small, natural or man-made, can hit anytime, anywhere and can affect anyone. Therefore, Knowledge and quick action in the face of a crisis may be the difference between life and death. 
It is important also to know that;
 Disaster can strike at anytime, anywhere and affect anyone. First aid can empower everyone, everywhere to save lives.

 First aid is the first step in the chain of survival when emergency strikes. 90 per cent of lives saved after a disaster is done by local people.

 First aid reduces vulnerabilities and helps build stronger communities, better preparing bystanders to react when the next disaster strikes.

 “First aid saves lives in emergencies. Everyone, everywhere can be a hero.”"||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/539768632821574/||||photo|2014-09-23T14:28:15+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Over 33,000 people from three Traditional Authorities (TAS) Nthache, Kanduku and Govati of Mwanza district are benefiting from a total of 635 Million Malawi kwacha from Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) through cash transfer. The development comes after the 2018 Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (Mvac) Report, which projected that 3.3 million Malawians would be food insecure following a 28.4 percent decrease in maize production last year.

According to the report, maize production decreased from 3,464,139 metric tons (MT) as per the 2016/17 Third Round Agricultural Production Estimates to 2,697,959 MT as per the 2017/18 third round estimates. “The affected population would require 138, 488 MT of maize relief worth K23.5 million”, the report stated.

MRCS started giving out money to the food insecure households in November 2018. The program is expected to phase out in March 2019.

Speaking on Wednesday in Mwanza during the cash distribution, MRCS President Levison Changole said MRCS came in with this response following the MVAC report that called upon partners to support. Changole thanked the Danish, Finnish and Icelandic Red Cross Societies for financial and technical support rendered to MRCS to enable it reach out to the vulnerable communities with the cash transfer program.

Syria: Attack on humanitarian convoy is an attack on humanity

Published: 20 September 2016

The Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) are outraged by last night’s horrific attack on a SARC warehouse and an aid convoy in Orem Al Kubra (Big Orem) in rural Aleppo.

Around twenty civilians and one SARC staff member were killed, as they were unloading trucks carrying vital humanitarian aid. Much of the aid was destroyed. The attack deprives thousands of civilians of much-needed food and medical assistance.

“We’re totally devastated by the deaths of so many people, including one of our colleagues, the director of our sub-branch, Omar Barakat. He was a committed and brave member of our family of committed staff and volunteers, working relentlessly to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people. It is totally unacceptable that our staff and volunteers continue to pay such a high price because of the ongoing fighting,"" said the SARC President, Dr Abdulrahman Attar.

“From what we know of yesterday's attack, there has been a flagrant violation of International Humanitarian Law (IHL), which is totally unacceptable. Failing to respect and protect humanitarian workers and structures might have serious repercussions on ongoing humanitarian operations in the country, hence depriving millions of people from aid essential to their survival”, said Peter Maurer, the ICRC President.

“Today, the Red Cross and Red Crescent is in mourning. In solidarity with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, we are calling on the international community to ensure the protection of humanitarian aid workers and volunteers. We are not part of this conflict,” said Tadateru Konoé, the President of the IFRC.

Syria is one of the most dangerous conflicts for humanitarian workers in the world. During the past six years, 54 staff and volunteers of SARC have lost their lives whilst carrying out their duties.

The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement repeats its demand that all parties to the conflict adhere to the rules of international humanitarian law, which includes protecting aid workers."|[]||https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/970096766455423/|1.0|||status|2016-09-20T22:06:44+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Speaking after a cash distribution exercise in Karonga on Sunday, MRCS disaster response and recovery specialist Chisomo Teputepu said the humanitarian organization will leave no stop unturned in responding to disasters in the country. 

“Our role as an institution is to assist government in disaster management. We work in disaster preparedness, response as well as recovery. That’s why as soon as we got news about the disaster, we responded swiftly to help the victims,” said Teputepu.

Preliminary findings indicated that the disaster affected 557 households. However, Teputepu said MRCS National Disaster Response Team (NDRT) found that 241 households were “in dire need of assistance”.

“So, we are giving out cash ranging from K20,000 to K64,000 for victims to repair their houses,” he said.
The cash transfers were done through crisis modifier compact funds under a project called Enhancing Resilience to Disasters in Malawi which receives funding from the European Union Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO).

Karonga district disaster officer Oswell Mkandawire said the strong winds caused injury to seven people; six people were treated as outpatients at Atupele Clinic while one was referred to Karonga District Hospital for further treatment. 
He said the winds also destroyed two classroom blocks and teacher’s houses at Kafulu and Kasantha primary schools. 

One of the victims Matilda Kisulu said the cash transfers have come at the right time when she had no money to rebuild her house.

“The winds destroyed everything that I had; the house, furniture and foodstuffs. Now I have nowhere to lean on. This cash will go a long way in rebuilding my home,” said the mother of seven."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1580178088780618/|4.0|||photo|2019-02-14T13:10:42+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS), with support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), hosted a week-long emergency health Regional Disaster Response Team training for 25 participants drawn from 15 Red Cross African nations. 

Speaking at the closing of the training at Protea Ryalls Hotel in Blantyre on Sunday, August 28 2016, MRCS Secretary General (SG) Ethel Kaimila Namaliya said the training is significant in disaster response as it has equipped Red Cross disaster responders to be effective in the way they respond to disasters more especially during health emergencies. 

“The main idea was to help them strengthen their knowledge and skills so that they are able to integrate health issues in coordination and cooperation with other key actors within the Southern African countries as well as within the East and the West Africa,” said Namaliya. 

She said apart from Ebola outbreak, there were a number of issues that were cited as requiring the responders’ quick action and they include sexual reproductive health (SRH) issues, maternal child health issues, nutrition issues, and gender-based violence issues, among others. 

Namaliya urged the leadership of African region to give space to the RDRT to practice so that they gain experience. She pledged that she would be playing an advocacy role to ensure national societies do release the RDRT during deployment.

Addressing the participants through telephone, IFRC Director for Africa Dr. Fatoumata Nafo-Traore said that it is very important for the region to have well trained RDRT. She assured them of her support.

IFRC emergency health coordinator for Africa Region Professor Thierno Balde who was one the facilitators at the training, speaking in an interview, said identifying the main health conditions affecting the region and its communities were one of the first step in organizing the training. 
Balde said once the health issues were identified, targeting and focusing the training in addressing them in the best way was one of the very best actions that facilitators and participants have done for the training. 

“You might probably recall that one or two years ago we faced a really major health issue, the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and then after that outbreak we just realized, not only us, but almost all of the international organizations, that we need to improve our response capacities in our region and as a region of the federation we started thinking about how we can proceed so this training is the first step of the process,” said Balde. 

He added that identifying the right people with the right profile and also training them, giving them the skills and the abilities is really critical and IFRC can confidently say it has a pool of people to send to the African region if something breaks somewhere. 

Malawi Red Cross Head of Health, Gloria Kunyenga who was one of the participants said that the participants have learnt how to respond to various kinds of disasters in terms of making sure that they coordinate well with other partners in order to know what they [the partners] are doing in order to be able to plan their interventions very well and accordingly to avoid duplication of interventions. 

Regional Disaster Response Team means different countries coming together and forming teams that can be able to respond to disasters that happen within the region. According to Kunyenga, what happens is that when one has been trained under this kind of training, whenever there is a disaster be it in Zimbabwe or South Sudan, he/she can be deployed to go and support in the response. 
Participants at the training were drawn from Kenya, Seychelles, South Sudan, Somalia, Sierra, Lesotho, Gambia, Ghana, Tanzania, Nigeria and Rwanda national societies, among others. Malawi the host had two participants. Facilitators at the seven-day training were drawn from Cameroon, Kenya, Finland, South Africa and Australia. 

Speaking towards the closing of the training, most participants commended the training packages and contents as well as the facilitators for coming up with such packages and contents by saying they will no longer be the same again.

At the end of it all the participants were awarded certificates.

Regional Disaster Response Teams (RDRT) are a cost-effective regional disaster response support system that is entirely staffed by members of National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The aim of RDRT is to actively promote building of regional capacities in disaster management."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/956396574492109/|5.0|||photo|2016-08-29T21:01:05+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

About 130 households who were affected by floods in Mulanje entered the New Year of 2019 with a smile when the Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) distributed cash through its Social Cash Transfer programme to help alleviate their suffering.

Heavy rains on December 23 caused flooding in the area of Traditional Authority (T/A) Mkanda destroying houses and property, leaving some of the affected families homeless.

Speaking after distributing the cash, disaster risk reduction project manager for Enhancing Resilience in Disasters in Malawi at the Malawi Red Cross Society George Mwimaniwa, said the society distributed about K4.6 million to the affected households to be used for either reconstruction of the damaged houses or replace some of the properties lost during the disaster.

“We are working hand in hand with the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA). Following the accident, we conducted an assessment where we identified these households, some had their houses completely destroyed while some lost few properties and we are distributing the funds per household according to the extent of the damage or the loss incurred,” said Mwimaniwa.

He further said with support from the European Union, the society is also reaching out to those affected by various forms of disasters as well as responding to the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC) report by providing humanitarian assistance in form of cash through social cash transfer to the affected population.

According to Mwimaniwa, the society will distribute close to K350 million in a period of five months to about 7,000 households in Mwanza.

One of the beneficiaries, Rhoda Mtokosa a 21-year-old single mother who lost her house during the accident, thanked Red Cross for the support which she said will go a long way in helping her replace some of the items she lost including, beddings, clothes, and kitchen utensils."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1575116119286815/|7.0|||photo|2019-01-02T09:54:25+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

The main objective of the workshop was to develop marketing plans so that the national societies can grow COFA to be a more effective, more profitable, and more productive operation. “To grow COFA successfully you need to think and function like businesses do” said Eric Decroix, one of the facilitators of the workshop.

“Taking SAF actions and measures will help MRCS staff and Volunteers to earn the trust and acceptance of people and communities in need and of those who control or influence access to them. As such it is very important to train MRCS staff and Volunteers so that they always take actions and measures recommended in the SAF that can considerably help mitigate the risks they face”. Said Kanongodza.

The orientation drew participants from elections violence hot spots in Blantyre district. Chairperson for MRCS Blantyre division Shadreck Mtambo said the training has come at the right time as the country is preparing for next year’s general elections, where the Red Cross actively participates with first aid coverage and Restoration of Family Links (RFL), among other services. 

Kanongodza thanked the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) for funding the training. He appealed to other partners for more support towards SAF to reach out to other divisions as there are still more gaps of SAF knowledge among many divisions."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1560536084078152/|7.0|||photo|2018-12-13T15:25:28+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Speaking on Thursday during the opening of the Southern Africa Partnership of Red Cross Societies (SAPRCS) meeting held in Malawi, the Minister of Health Honorable Atupele Muluzi MP who represented His Excellency the president of the republic of Malawi and patron of Malawi Red society Professor Arthur Peter Mutharika, said the government of Malawi appreciates the Humanitarian work the Red Cross does globally, Southern Africa region and Malawi in particular. He said the Red Cross Collaborate with government in many areas, siting Health and Disaster management as priority areas of collaboration.

“As Southern Africa is projected to be one of the most vulnerable regions to the impacts of climate change, resulting in floods and cyclones to affect several countries, and that there is a 70 per cent probability of an El Niño event in 2019, that will lead to lead to further deterioration in food insecurity particularly following the low and erratic rainfall recorded to date in 2018, There is need for the red cross to collaborate with governments in the region to effectively respond” said the minister.

In her remarks, IFRC Director for Africa Dr Fatoumata Traore requested the Minister to lobby with the ministers of Health in the region and heads of state governments for governments’ increased support to the Red Cross. Traore commended the Government of Malawi for hosting the SAPRCS meeting which was held out of South Africa for the first time. 

Chairperson of SAPRCS who is also the president of Lesotho Red Cross Mr. Silas Mosuhli said SAPRCS aims at encouraging and strengthening the collaboration, cooperation and self-determination of National Red Cross Societies of the Southern African Region To provide space for National Societies to share, learn from and support each other in order to achieve a greater level of self-sustainability.

The meeting which was attended by Leaders from the 10 National Societies in Southern Africa Region, IFRC, ICRC and  12 representatives from Sister National Societies who support these National Societies as enshrined in the Red Cross principles of humanity, unity and universality,  was held under the theme “Building a Stronger Network for more resilient communities”."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1544644582333969/|7.0|||photo|2018-11-24T04:28:38+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

In readiness to respond to disasters that may be, Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) has formulated the 2018 - 2019 Contingency Plan which aims at  preparing MRCS to respond well to an emergency and its potential humanitarian impact. 

Speaking in Mponela during the 3 days formulation of the MRCS response Contingency Plan, MRCS Planning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting Manager Franklin Yonamu said developing a contingency plan involves making decisions in advance about the management of human and financial resources, coordination and communications procedures, and being aware of a range of technical and logistical responses.

The Plan is a management tool, involving all sectors relevant to an effective and efficient disaster response, which can help ensure timely and effective provision of humanitarian aid to those most in need when a disaster occurs. 

“Time spent in contingency planning equals time saved when a disaster occurs. This contingency planning process is basically broken down into addressing three simple questions, which are: What is likely going to happen in light of weather or seasonal forecast? What are we going to do about it? And what can MRCS do ahead of time to get prepared?” Added Yonamu.

In line with the Malawi Government National Contingency Response plan, following the seasonal forecast which indicates that Malawi should expect normal to above normal rainfall amounts over the north and most of northern parts of central Malawi, while normal to below normal rainfall amounts over the south and most of southern parts of central Malawi during the 2018/2019 rainfall season, MRCS has prioritized Floods, Strong Winds, Cholera, Dry Spells.

Civil unrest has also been targeted in the elections contingency plan due to General Elections taking place in May 2019."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1534621833336244/|8.0|||photo|2018-11-09T22:54:48+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Secretary General for International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent, Elhadj As Sy, said that there is need for countries like Malawi to prepare for shocks so that they don’t turn into disasters every time they occur.

Sy said that shocks are always going to be there but the level of preparedness by the communities and nations at large where they may occur is what can determine whether the shocks can be described as disasters or not. 

“Shocks will always arrive we all know that, but will they have to be a disaster every time they come? No, possibly not. Our level of preparedness, our capacity on the ground, the early warning that we are able to do on it, the early action that we are able to take on it and the capacity that we are able to invest on the communities so that they are able to resist shock next time around, all that will collectively determine whether the shock next time it occurs is going to be a disaster or not,” Said Sy.

By Charity Manondo

In order to increase access and adequate supply of blood in Malawi, MRCS in partnership with MTBS last week organized a football bonanza with the aim of recruiting more blood donors. The activity took place at Kasiya football ground in TA khongoni in Lilongwe district.

As an auxiliary body to the government, MRCS is carrying out a project called blood donor recruitment which started in July 2017 and it will phase out in December 2019. This project is being funded by Swiss Red Cross and is being implemented in TAs Lundu and Msomba in Blantyre and in TAs khongoni and kabudula Lilongwe respectively. 

Speaking on the event, MRCS district project officer Meckson Kaferapanjira Phiri, said MRCS thought of a football bonanza as a strong event of bringing more people together especially the youths in order to donate blood and also learn the importance of donating blood to those in need.

A blood donor, Paul Subili said it is very important to donate blood in order to save many lives in our hospitals. “My wife once suffered from anemia and she was saved by unknown donor hence there is need for me to save others even though I do not know the person who will be saved by my blood” he added.

Although MRCS is trying its best to recruit more blood donors, a lot of people still do not understand the importance of donating blood. MBTS which is the only mandated body to collect blood in the country is failing to meet blood demand as it manages to collect only 70% of the required 120 000 units annually.

As victorious, Swati FC got twenty thousand kwacha while runners up Kasiya select got ten thousand kwacha while the remaining ten thousand was shared between the other two participating teams.

“We are very happy as a team and the money which has been given to us as winners will be utilized wisely”. Said captain for Swati FC Stephen Phalira. “The blood which has been collected on this event will help a lot of people in need of blood in our hospitals”, he added with excitement.

Blood donor recruitment project is targeting 245, 300 people in the two targeted areas in Lilongwe."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1532580276873733/|4.0|||photo|2018-11-05T12:15:31+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

The day was commemorated under theme “reducing economic losses from disasters has the power to transform lives”.

The United Nations General Assembly designated 13th October to celebrate the international day for disaster reduction to promote a global culture of disaster reduction, including disaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness. Malawi as a nation has been prone to natural disasters since 1990’s. The development has indeed affected the economy and even lives of many Malawians.

Sharing the 2015 floods experience during the commemoration sideline event at Cross Roads hotel, MRCS disaster manager, Mr. Joseph Moyo said the year 2015 brought unforgettable moments to many lives and even the nation of Malawi. He further said that beside lack of sufficient funding, MRCS managed to support the victims affected by the disasters by providing them with food and shelter, among other things. 

“On 15th December 2017 there were heavy rains which caused flooding and about 1628 houses were destroyed and also 8173 people were affected” said the a Lilongwe Kaliyeka block leader. The block leader added that MRCS and other organizations came to their rescue by proving them with food and shelter.

UN deputy resident coordinator who is also WFP Representative, Benoit Thiry said natural and man-made disasters are among the main drivers of hunger, malnutrition and poverty. He further said in the year of 2018, over 320 people have already been left homeless as a result of the heavy rains which destroyed their homes in Mzuzu.  He added that the 2016 El Nino induced food insecurity response coasted Malawi 395 million dollars to cover food, agriculture and other sector needs. This reflects on the costs of disasters and how much can be saved if such disasters are prevented. 

Deputy Mayor for Lilongwe city council, Juliana Kaduya said the Lilongwe city council has formulated bylaws which will deter people from constructing houses along the river banks. She further said if anyone will be found constructing a house in restricted areas it means he or she will be punished according to the laws. 

Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security, Cecilia Chazama who presided over the commemoration ceremony said this year’s theme has the power to transform lives. She further urged all the people to make Malawi a disaster resilient nation."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1523594501105644/|4.0|||photo|2018-10-23T04:10:57+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Speaking in Blantyre  at the end the of the 4 days CEA training for 30 MRCS staff, Director of Programs and Development, Mrs Prisca Chisala said the integration of CEA in programming will improve the delivery of MRCS services, siting involvement of communities at all levels of the program as a strong tool to successful implementation of the programs.

The training was facilitated by Sharon Reader- CEA senior adviser for Africa, Eva Erlach - CEA Delegate for Africa, Patrick Phiri - CEA Focal Lead for MRCS and Boston Kadzamira - CEA Co-lead. “Community Engagement and Accountability is not a standalone project, it is an approach to Red Cross/Red Crescent programming and operations. It is supported by a set of activities that help put communities at the center of what we do, by integrating communication and participation through the program cycle or operations.” Reader said.

Commenting on the training, Elliot Nazonse (Mangochi district Project officer) one of the participants, said CEA will provide timely, relevant and actionable life-serving and life-enhancing information to the communities. He added listening to community’s needs, feedback and complaints will ensure communities’ active participation that will guide Red Cross actions across all MRCS programs.

Patrick Phiri, one of the facilitators said MRCS now has a platform to lead in rolling out CEA in Malawi through training other humanitarian organizations besides creating a national CEA network."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1510498715748556/|5.0|||photo|2018-10-05T23:04:57+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

In the face of continued crimes against persons with albinism in Malawi and beyond, the Malawi Red Cross Society through its social inclusion programme is empowering members of the community in its impact areas. Chrisy George, a person with albinism serves as a MRCS volunteer in Kasanga Village, Mangochi. 

‘’As you can see I am an albino but through the social inclusion programme run by the Malawi Red Cross Society, I gained confidence and I am an active participant bringing change to my community. I go round my village visiting house to house teaching and encouraging the community members to observe hygiene practices,’’ she explains. 

Chrisy, who believes in the saying that disability is not inability, divides her time between attending to daily household chores and serving the community with ease despite the occasional social discrimination and fear for her safety. Mangochi Police records indicate that there have been six reported cases of violations against persons with albinism in the district, a thing which would otherwise confine the twenty-eight mother of two at home.

‘’How could I confine myself home, living in fear when the Malawi Red Cross Society is building my capacity? I am a member of this community and like everyone else I have a duty to serve and make a difference to the nation,’’ she explains matter of fact.

Kasanga village has a team of three lady volunteers, which is another source of confidence for Chrisy. Her coach Emily Kaunda, describes Chrisy as dependable. 

‘’We have a household visit schedule of two to three days visits per week to households in our area of operation. Chrisy has never been absent for no apparent reason. Actually we are motivated by her dedication,’’ said Kaunda.

Kaunda adds that the area has tremendously improved in water sanitation and hygiene since MRCS started the implementation of the community resilience program with support from a consortium of Danish Red Cross, Italian Red Cross, Icelandic Red Cross and Finnish Red Cross. ‘’For example, before the roll-out of the project, this village had only 46 pit latrines of very poor quality, but now with the project’s interventions, all the 117 households boast of toilets, tip-tap for hand washing, bathrooms and other amenities,’’ she explains. 
Kaunda attributes this achievement to Chrisy as an agent of change, saying it is because of her dedication to dissemination of messages of behavioral change that has earned this results.

MRCS District Project Officer (DPO) for Mangochi, Elliot Nazonse said that the social inclusion component of the project builds capacity and makes room for vulnerable members of communities participate in different activities. ‘’ We feel persons with albinism, like Chrisy, and those with any form of disability are crucial to our programs. When they are active participants, the change we are seeking will be easily achieved,’’ He points out. 

Nazonse said in matters such as hygiene, any deviation by a single person, due to exclusion, may result in disaster for the whole village. ‘’ You know diseases spread from one person to another, if we leave out someone for any reason, including those with disability, that person may be the origin of the disease spread to the whole community,’’ he reasons. 

Community Resilience Project is being implemented in the three districts of Chikwawa, Mangochi and Mwaza with Health, Disaster, WASH, and Social Inclusion and Organizational development as focus areas. Currently 13910 households are being reached out in Mangochi alone."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1469088479889580/|3.0|||photo|2018-08-14T07:37:59+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

In order to increase proportion of orphans and vulnerable children accessing secondary education, Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) in partnership Belgian Red Cross is supporting secondary school going students with educational support under Orphan and Vulnerable Children component of the  Community Based Health and Care project being implemented in the area of  Traditional Authority (TA) Kapelura in Kasungu district.

The two year Project which started in 2016 is paying school fees, buying uniforms, shoes and learning materials to 100 vulnerable children. Of the 100 students, 60 are boys while 40 are girls. 

One of the beneficiaries, a form 3 pupil at Kapelura Community day secondary school (CDSS),  Isaac Phiri who is 19 years old from Katambadzuwa village said the red cross came to his rescue from dropping out of school. He said before he was identified and started receiving education support from the red cross, he faced many challenges ranging from School fees, uniform, shoes and learning materials. 

“I was about to drop out of school because of lack of education support. But now I am very happy, am able to attend classes without being chased out of school because of school fees and uniform. Thanks to the Red Cross for this support. Only God will reward you.” Said Isaac, who wants to become a soldier or a journalist after completion of his education.

A future female police officer Agnes Mankhwala, 18 years old and in form 4 said she stayed home for 1 full term because of school fees and thought her dream was shuttered. She said she couldn’t believe that she was selected to benefit from the bursary. She said she is working hard in class so that she gets good grades and realize her dream. Agnes advised fellow students who are on the Red Cross bursary to work hard. 

Mr. Henley Kasomphe head teacher at Kapelura CDSS applauded MRCS for coming to the rescue of the needy pupils who he said without the Red Cross these pupils would have left school some time back. He said since the Red Cross started the education support, turn up and performance of the the pupils has increased. 

Boston Kadzamila, Program Manager for the project said the implementation of the project is on course.  Kadzamila attributed success of the project to flexibility of the donor, siting extension of the project period with few more months as evidence.

Magdalena Mariko a guardian of three orphans from Chifuka village Traditional Authority (TA) Khongoni in Lilongwe was on Monday very happy as she was one of the 580 beneficiaries of Blankets that Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) distributed in the area curtsey of Japanese Blankets for Africa Campaign (JBAG).

“I am very happy to have received this blanket, I look after 3 orphans and blankets have been a problem especially when it is cold. But now the children will not suffer from cold related diseases because of this warm blanket.” Said Magdalena.
Speaking after witnessing the blankets distribution JBAG representative from Japan Kazuhiro Tanaka said he is happy with the selected beneficiaries and the distribution process. 

Tanaka added that the people of Japan are motivated to send more blankets every year because they are convinced that the blankets are going to the intended beneficiaries. He committed that JBAG will continue sending the blankets to Malawi in the years to come.

In an interview with the media, MRCS Secretary General McBain Kanongodza said he was happy to note that JBAG has sent to Malawi a total of 304,850 blankets since 2001 which have reached out to many people. He added that despite a blanket being a basic need,  many vulnerable communities do not afford it, hence MRCS intervention to fill the gap.

19,200 pieces of blankets are expected to be distributed this year in an exercise that started in May 2018."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1444609775670784/|4.0|||photo|2018-07-24T14:01:45+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Tomorrow (September 14, 2013) we celebrate World First Aid Day. This year we are focusing on the theme ‘First Aid and Road Safety’.

 Every year, some 1.24 million people are killed in road accidents worldwide . Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for young people aged 15-29. Within 20 years, road accidents are likely to be the fifth biggest killer worldwide.

We can shift this worrying trend. The Red Cross Red Crescent worldwide is asking for legislative provisions to make quality first aid training compulsory for every individual seeking to obtain a driving licence. Based on our experience as the world’s leading first aid provider and educator, we also recognize that first aid training is essential for all people at all stages of their life – at home, in school, at the workplace.

For more than 100 years, first aid has been one of our main services. Our experience shows that first aid reduces vulnerabilities and helps build stronger communities. Everyone should have access to first aid training, not just those who can pay for it.

Join us in our call to make first aid training a priority in every country.  The IFRC Global First Aid Reference Centre, hosted and supported by the French Red Cross, has prepared a number of communication tools to help you in this task.

Watch our animation and spread the message further: first aid saves lives. It’s for everyone, everywhere!

Yours sincerely,

 
Bekele Geleta

 “What we have seen here is beyond our expectation. We would like to partner with MRCS to assist us in the areas of Cash transfer programing in areas of Beneficiary registration, market assessment feedback mechanism and use of ODK and Mega V tools in electronic cash transfer distribution”. Thomas said.

Mr. McBain Kanongodza, Secretary general for MRCS said the visit was timely as it was a test to MRCS to get feedback on how it was fairing and  knowing areas to improve the system.

His Excellency the state president of the republic of Malawi Professor Arthur Peter Mutharika who is also the patron of Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) has urged Malawians and the Private sector in Malawi to support Malawi Red Cross.

The remarks were made on Tuesday at Sanjika Palace in Blantyre during the launch of the 2018 Red Cross flag week. Mutharika said MRCS does a very commendable work in saving lives of Malawians during disasters, sitting this year’s Kaliyeka, Mchesi, Biwi and Mtandire flodds in Lilongwe for example where Red Cross Volunteers were first responders and last to leave the affected areas.  He said the humanity work MRCS does in Malawi cannot go without cerebration, hence his acceptance to inaugurate the flag week.

He appealed to the private sector to invest more in the welfare of the vulnerable communities by donating to MRCS. On his part, the president assured MRCS that he is committed to see to it that Government budgetary support to MRCS resumes. He then made a personal d
onation of 1 Million Kwacha cheque to Malawi Red Cross Society.
Speaking during the event MRCS president Levison Changole thanked the president for inaugurating the Red Cross flag week besides his busy schedule. He assured government that MRCS will continue to provide a diverse and enterprising range of services tailored to the needs of vulnerable local communities, helping people prepare for, deal with and recover from crisis. 

“This year’s flag week campaign cerebrated under a theme “Everywhere for Everyone” aims to broaden public understanding of the work of the Red Cross and Red Crescent by featuring the diverse and innovative range of services around the world, and challenging the traditional view of Movement with a smile. The Malawi Red Cross Society has been involved in disasters engaging policy and decision makers on humanitarian action, visiting detainees and supporting vulnerable migrants and refugees through tracing and restoration of family links among other things.”

Red Cross flag week is an annual fund-raising event held every May to mobilize resources and donations to enable the society raise funds necessary to respond to disasters that mostly benefit those people in need. It is also used as an opportunity to sensitize and remind people on the importance of saving lives and to take part in humanitarian activities in natural disasters.

On 22nd March every year the world commemorates world water day. This is a day which focuses its attention on the importance of water. 

Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) joins the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the world in commemorating this day under a theme WASH and Disability Inclusion.

Commenting on the theme, MRCS district project officer for Chikwawa Cecilia Banda said MRCS has changed the lives of communities in Traditional Authority (TA) Chapananga in Chikwawa by scaling up water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) activities among other things through provision of good portable water and construction of improved ventilated pit latrines which have taken into considerations the people with different disabilities. Banda said the toilet facilities were designed to accommodate the children with disabilities a move which has seen children with disabilities access them with ease.

Banda said the latrines were provided to schools as one way of improving issues of sanitation under a four year ‘Community Resilience project’ which has Health, Water Sanitation and Hygiene, Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) as well as the Social Inclusion, as major components that are playing a crucial role in the lives of the communities.

She added that the social inclusion component targets the most marginalized groups to make sure they are included in all activities and decision making. The component has so far provided support to the marginalized groups by among others the provision of VIP Latrines to Primary Schools.

“The program has constructed the latrines with hand washing facilities that are disability friendly that have enabled even the learners using the wheelchairs to easily access them.” She said.
According to Banda, MRCS values the community based implementation approach which puts at heart community engagement in all its operations.

So far, the program serves a population of around 6,000 school going learners in the three schools of Bwemba, Phwadzi and Malesi in Group Village Headmen of Timbenao, Tombondera and Galonga.

Apart from promoting sanitation in schools the project through its volunteers engaged the communities through house to house visits and mobilized each household to own a toilet with a drop hole cover and a hand washing facility with soap."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1346360432162386/|4.0|||photo|2018-03-22T16:48:43+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Malawi Red Cross Society on Monday held the first Red Cross talk hour. This is a 1 hour meeting under recourse mobilization which was organized for potential individual donors to get firsthand information of the work of the Red Cross in Malawi. 

In his welcoming remarks Secretary General for MRCS, McBain Kanongodza said Malawi has a lot of people that can support the work of the Red Cross only if they knew what the organization does and the challenges it is facing, hence organizing the meeting. 

Mr White, a resident of Ntandire who lost his 20 year old son due to 2017 flooding in Lilongwe commended the Red Cross for saving his life during the floods. He said Red Cross was the first organization that came to their rescue and supported them throughout their predicament.

Another person who commended the work of the Red Cross was  Ausa Osman a form 2 female student at Mbombwe Community Day Secondary School in Mangochi. Ausa said she had dropped out of school when she was in standard 8 and got married because of poverty. She thanks Red Cross which through its community resilience project played a major role in ending the marriage and brought her back to school. She further told the gathering that Red Cross is paying for her school fees and supporting her with all her learning materials.

Speaking after touring the pavilions mounted by Red Cross to showcase some of the work of the Red Cross, Mr. Ahab Kafansiyanji said the participants were deeply moved with the humanitarian work the organization was doing. He commended Red Cross for serving the vulnerable communities in the country.  Kafansiyanji urged Malawians to help the Red Cross achieve its goals of helping vulnerable communities by financially supporting its work.

The participants to the meeting were invited based on the connections they already have with the existing staff members, volunteers or people who are already in contact with the Red Cross.

The model of the meeting focuses on making partnerships with individual donors who later become Red Cross Volunteers, donors or link the Red Cross to funding opportunity. He therefor appealed to the participants to have interest in the humanitarian work the organization was engaged in.

MRCS branch, youth and resource mobilization manager Leonard Maganga, said Red Cross talk hour also known as point of entry would be held every month."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1346002922198137/|4.0|||photo|2018-03-22T03:44:07+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

“Today I have visited some of the projects that MRCS is doing here in Malawi, Ntchisi district in particular, to say the fact these people are doing great work, we have seen the students who are being supported with school fees, learning materials and other resources, the CBCCs, people living with HIV and the pass on of goats which generates in come especially to the people in rural areas,” said Kashima.

She therefore commended MRCS Ntchisi division volunteers who are working vigorously in supporting the vulnerable communities. 

“These people do not receive any allowance or salary, they are just volunteers. They deserve a credit, they are very committed with their work, they are here just to help their communities,” she said.

MRCS Program Manager Leonard Maganga said all the work is carried out by the volunteers. The Headquarters just provide the division with finance and technical assistance.

“The activities are interlinked and complement one other. Apart from taking care of the sick, we are doing the Goat pass on program to the people affected by HIV at the same time assisting orphan and under five children at the CBCCs,” explained Maganga.

He said MRCS in partnership with JRC through the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has in 2017 and 2018 alone supported 100 Secondary School pupils by paying school fees and giving them learning materials such as scientific calculators, mathematical instruments, note books pencils and others. Over 1,000 under five children are benefiting from the intervention through four Community Based Care Centers.

14 years Evelyn Mwandumba, of Ntchisi Secondary School commended the Japanese Red Cross for the support they have been giving to her since she was enrolled on bursary program.

“Previously it was not easy to pay for my school fees.  It was very hard for me to access education. I could not afford to pay school fees and buy other school leaning materials unless I go for piece works at the Boma which was very hard, but now here I am in school, Thanks to support from the Japanese Red Cross”. She added."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1330550493743380/|9.0|||photo|2018-02-27T18:18:00+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Government has hailed Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) and Village Hygiene Projects for their interventions that have seen three Traditional Authorities in Mangochi achieve Open Defecation Free (ODF) status.

Celebrations for the attainment of the ODF status for the three TAs Chowe, Namavi and STA Chiunda, were held on Saturday at Chimbende Primary School in TA Chowe where Minister of Health, Atupele Muluzi, presented certificates to the three TAs.

The minister said government always appreciates complementary support that organizations such as MRCS render to government especially in promoting ODF, a programme government started in 2008.

“We applaud Malawi Red Cross Society and Hygiene Village Projects for working with the people in the three TAs to ensure that each and every household owns and uses a well-covered toilet and that they wash hands with soap after visiting the toilets,” said Muluzi.

The minister said it is interventions like these that see Mangochi registering no single case of cholera while close to 600 cases and 12 deaths have been recorded across the country since the disease broke out in Karonga in November 2017.

Muluzi hailed Mangochi chiefs, health officers and Red Cross volunteers in the district for keeping cholera at bay and urged them to ensure that every household uses treated water at all times.

MRCS President, Levison Changole, said there is a very good collaboration between MRCS and health workers and that the TAs and their subjects have been very supportive throughout the implementation of the community resilience project which is being supported by a consortium of Danish, Finnish, Icelandic and Italian Red Cross Societies.

Changole said MRCS will continue to support government in the area of promotion of hygiene and sanitation in line with Sustainable Development Goal number 6.2 which urges countries to achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, including those in the vulnerable situations by 2030.

“At Malawi Red Cross Society we realise that it is only a healthy society that can contribute efficiently to the development of the country and to fight diseases better there is need to enforce hygiene and sanitation,” said Changole.

He added: “My appeal to the people of Mangochi, especially in the three TAs we are celebrating here, is for them to embrace the development and move forward with it even after we have pulled out.”

The MRCS President also hailed government for its support through the health office both at district and community levels and other sister National Societies namely: Danish Red Cross, Icelandic Red Cross, Finish Red Cross and Italian Red Cross for their financial support which has necessitated the ODF status in Mangochi.

Hygiene Village Project Executive Director, Roy Khonyongwa, said the ODF Status in the three TAs was achieved through a process called Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) where communities played a leading role in finding solutions to sanitation gaps.

Khonyongwa hailed the three TAs and their subjects for accepting the intervention and he concurred with the MRCS President in appealing to the people to sustain the good hygiene and sanitation practices they had learned.

Before the celebrations, the minister visited two households where he sampled their respective toilets and hand-washing outfit commonly called (Mpondagiya). The minister was briefed on how the households use the facilities.

Chowe, Namavi and Chiunda bring the number of TAs with ODF status in the country to 86 with 177 TAs yet to achieve the status, according to Health Minister, Atupele."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1328834617248301/|6.0|||photo|2018-02-26T11:45:10+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Government has commended Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) for responding swiftly to the Floods that hit some parts of Lilongwe on Saturday.

The remarks were made on Sunday afternoon by the Vice President of the republic of Malawi Dr. Saulos Klaus Chilima when he visited the area to appreciate the damage caused by the floods.

On 16th December, 2017 Lilongwe City central received heavy rainfall resulting into flooding of Mchesi River in the process affecting over 700 households, registering 7 deaths and unknown number of people reported missing,  202 houses completely collapsed and many more others damaged,. The affected areas include Chipasula, Kawale 1 and Kaliyeka.
MRCS volunteers and staff got to the area immediately after receiving the news of the floods and offered search and rescue and First Aid.

 MRCS has since donated blankets and Kitchen Utensils which the Vice President handed over to the survivors of the floods.
MRCS Disaster Management Manager Joseph Moyo said MRCS volunteers will continue with the search and rescue as many people are still missing. He added that MRCS will give more support after analyzing the assessment report which will inform the support needed.

The 2017/2018 seasonal forecast indicated that during the period October 2017 to March 2018 a greater part of the country will experience normal total rainfall amounts. However, episodes of extreme weather events such as prolonged dry spells and floods may occur in some places associated with the neutral ENSO conditions during the forecast period. Since mid-November, 2017, the Country started receiving rains throughout the country."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1283174508480979/|6.0|||photo|2017-12-17T18:47:08+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Statement03 APRIL 2015
Yemen / Syria: Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement condemns killing of four more Red Crescent workers
 Joint statement, ICRC, IFRC, Sana'a / Damascus / Geneva – Two brothers working for the local branch of the Yemen Red Crescent Society were shot dead today in the southern port city of Aden while evacuating wounded people to a waiting ambulance. Disaster-management coordinator Khaled Ahmed Bahuzaim and relief volunteer Mohammed Ahmed Bahuzaim were both bearing the red crescent emblem, which should have ensured their protection. The death of the two men follows the killing of another Yemen Red Crescent volunteer worker in Al-Dhale' province three days ago.

Also earlier today, two Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) volunteers, Ibrahim Eid from the Idlib branch and Mohamad Ahmad Kamouaa from the Maaret al-Nouman sub-branch, were killedwhile carrying out their duties. They were retrieving dead bodies from near the Idlib branch of the SARC and preparing shelters for people fleeing the fighting in the city.

""In Yemen we are seeing Red Crescent volunteers being deliberately killed as they strive to save others. This is the third senseless death in a single week. This is a very worrying trend and a tragic loss,"" said Robert Mardini, who heads operations for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in the Near and Middle East. ""Meanwhile in Syria, as the humanitarian situation deteriorates, Ibrahim and Mohamad's deaths reflect the difficulties and dangers that SARC volunteers and other aid workers are facing there every day.""

Casualties of fierce ground fighting in Yemen have been heaviest in Aden, with local hospitals struggling to cope with the influx of wounded. The medical supplies that the ICRC provided to those hospitals previously are now running short, and fierce clashes are making it nearly impossible for aid workers to move around the city.

""Under no circumstances should aid workers come under attack. Yemen Red Crescent volunteers are working tirelessly to meet growing humanitarian needs under extreme circumstances. They must not be targeted for doing this job. We call for an immediate stop to these attacks,"" said Elias Ghanem, director of the Middle East and North Africa region for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. ""In Syria, 42 SARC and eight Palestine Red Crescent volunteers have now lost their lives since the beginning of the conflict, all of them killed while carrying out their humanitarian duties. This is outrageous and unacceptable.""

The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement once again calls upon all parties involved in the conflict in Syria to respect its humanitarian work and guarantee the safety of aid workers and their unimpeded, immediate access to people in need across the country. Without that respect for humanitarian workers, ambulances and health facilities, it will become close to impossible to continue saving lives and providing much-needed assistance to millions of Syrians.

All parties to conflict are obliged under international humanitarian law to respect medical neutrality and to grant medical personnel, equipment and vehicles safe passage. It is strictly prohibited to attack the staff and volunteers of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and all aid workers whose sole purpose is to provide humanitarian relief in emergencies.

Malawi Red Cross Society Secretary General  Mr. McBaing Kanongodza has hailed Danish Red Cross for supporting Malawi Red Cross to implement an innovative Forecast Based Financing (FBF) intervention, the first of its kind in Malawi.  Kanongodza said this during the opening of a one week long  FBF training that ended on Friday at Malawi Sun Hotel in Blantyre.

Kanongodza said much can be done to reduce the risk and impact of disasters and thus avoid unnecessary human suffering because FBF allows people to take a trigger based action such as moving to upland, stocking food, shelter and other relief items before disaster such as flood strike.

According to one of the resource persons at the workshop, Irene Amuron, technical Advisor on Forecast Based Financing from the Red Cross Climate Center,  FbF consists of three important elements to enable early action. Amuron said first is a set of agreed triggers that determine when to take action, based on risk analysis and dynamic forecast monitoring, second are predefined actions to be taken when those triggers are met, based on roles and responsibilities for those actions enshrined in standard operating procedures, then a financing mechanism to automatically fund those actions with ease. 

The overarching principle in Forecast Based Financing is that many more lives and livelihoods can be saved if people utilize the window of opportunity between forecast and the moment disaster strike to respond. FbF releases humanitarian funding based on forecast information for planned activities which reduce risks, enhance preparedness and response, and make disaster risk management overall more effective. 

At the end of the workshop MRCS with technical assistance from the Danish Red Cross developed   trigger based action guide with thresholds and trigger-based actions and Forecast-based Financing Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs)Standard operating procedures to guide the implementation of FBF."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1274214169377013/|6.0|||photo|2017-12-04T16:16:58+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Kirstine said this in Mangochi when a delegation from Denmark visited Mangochi last week to appreciate the work they are supporting through Danish Red Cross. During the visit MRCS opened and handed over a Ventilated improved Pit Latrine at Nangwazi primary school and a borehole at Likulungwa village. 

Speaking after touring the projects, Martin Pedersen from DSV Air and Sea LTD commended MRCS staff and volunteers for the work they are doing in serving the vulnerable communities.

Marius Viljoen, Managing Director for DSV Malawi said he was very happy with the intervention being done in the communities. “It was absolutely astonishing and spine chilling to see the impact which the Red Cross is doing in Malawi, and seeing the joy on the faces of the people, was incredible”.  Said Marius.

During the visit, the delegation visited rehabilitated borehole at Malombe primary school, Bamboo field at Kadewere village, Queens and Kings CBCC where they appreciated the school feeding program, Wadikanga under five climic, Manena model village, Masanje CDSS- Sprint session and Meso village where they witnessed household visits by the volunteers.

Meso village headman thanked the Red Cross volunteers for their untiring efforts in uplifting the health status of the village.

When the flood waters started to rise near her home in Nsanje, Malawi, Red Cross volunteer Febbi Kalenga knew that she had to move her family to higher ground. She fled to Bangula, where she joined others who had lost everything in Malawi’s worst floods in two generations. 
Febbi now lives in the temporary camp in Bangula along with 6,000 others who have also lost their homes, their crops and their livelihoods. Conditions are difficult for Febbi, a single mother of seven, who struggles daily to feed her children. All eight family members currently live in a tent provided by the Malawi Red Cross Society.
Despite the challenges she is facing, Febbi feels compelled to help other families who are sharing her struggle. Febbi has been a Red Cross volunteer for 12 years with the local Nsanje branch and the floods have not dampened her spirit of volunteerism. She has been working around the clock to assist those in need. Every day, she visits people in their tents, spreading hygiene promotion messages, checking if anyone is ill and needs care, and assisting camp managers with relief and food distribution. 
She reassures a camp resident who was in tears because she had missed out on a food distribution. Febbi explains that being asked for help is common, ""When people have a problem in the camp they come to the Red Cross volunteers. They come to us for health problems. They come if they have no food. They come for everything! They know we understand them and that we will try to help where we can.""
Now Febbi faces a new challenge. Cholera has broken out in Nsanje and poses a significant threat to those displaced by the flood waters. It is vital to the health and survival of the camp residents that cholera does not spread into Bangula camp. 
To help with the prevention effort, Febbi is participating in cholera prevention training run by the Malawi Red Cross Society, with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and the Ministry of Health. The Red Cross is conducting the same training in four flood-affected districts, reaching 250 volunteers. 
During her training, Febbi is learning the key hygiene messages that will help prevent the spread of cholera, the key symptoms of cholera, how and when to refer ill people for treatment, and the basic recommendations for preparing and administering oral rehydration solution, which is the first option for treatment. 
Through an emergency appeal, IFRC has been supporting the Malawi Red Cross Society to respond to the flood crisis since early January. With the reality of the situation becoming clear, and at least 230,000 now homeless because of the floods, IFRC has revised its emergency appeal and is now seeking 4 million Swiss francs to allow Red Cross volunteers to continue distributing tents and shelter materials, kitchen utensils, blankets and mosquito nets. Teams of staff and volunteers are also restoring water sources, desludging contaminated latrines and building new latrine facilities.  The appeal addresses the immediate needs of 46,712 displaced people, while also seeking to reduce the impact of the loss of crops and livelihoods, and help communities become more resilient to future floods. The appeal is currently 37 per cent funded."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/620203931444710/|5.0|||photo|2015-03-10T12:02:26+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

On a hot Sunday afternoon, they packed their travelling bags at the back of a project vehicle going to a destination they have never been to. ‘It is like a dream that this is my first trip outside Ntchisi’ remarked Ruth. Everybody laughs and start asking each other the places they have been to. It was only Judith who has been to Lilongwe some 40 kilomenters and non has ever travelled 400 kilometers down south to Zomba the current destination. This is the story of four young girls plucked from one of the poor rural Malawi to undergo a one and half year training in midwivery at Malawi College of Health Sciences in Zomba. Thanks to Korean Red Cross Society, Community Chest of Korea and Sumsang who have provided funding for their training.
 
At MRCS Ntchisi office: Rea Nzoma, Ruth Kasiya, Judith Mthawanji and Eunice Mangulu
Malawi Red Cross with technical and financial support from Korean National Red Cross Society, Community Chest of Korea and Sumsang is upgrading Mndimba and Sambakusi health posts to meet national standards to be able to provide maternal health services as part of the District Health System. At each site, the upgrading consists of training of midwives, construction of maternity wards and midwife houses, renovation of current infrastructures, construction of toilets, provision of solar lighting and supplies. The midwives training support includes all the fees, uniforms, education materials and transport to school. After completion of their studies the midwives will be recruited as civil servants and posted to the two health posts. A contract will be signed by the midwives that they will not leave the health post for a period of five years. Furthermore, there will be an MOU with the district council to ensure that there will be a midwife at the health post all the times.
Eunice, at 19 years is the youngest. She together with  Ruth who is 25 years comes from Mndimba health post. During this interaction she was just smiling without saying anything. As the driver, Andrew Simon, was starting the engine she looked outside smile and tears drop out of her eyes. ‘I do not know how to say thank you to Red Cross,’ were her first words. ‘My father was retired from civil service due to sickness. Who could have given me one million five hundred thousand Malawi Kwacha to do my tertiary education.’ She asked apparently no one. Ruth just hugged her as if to comfort her. Ruth herself was a Red Cross volunteer at Mndimba health post. She says she is happy that women will no longer walk 30 kilometers to Chinguluwe Health Centre for maternal health services. ‘Women in my communty faces many problems when delivering babies and it pained me that all I could do is to provide health education when they are delivering without skilled midwives’. She said. Long distance to health centres and lack of adequate midwives are two major problems contributing to high maternal mortality in Malawi. Currently, the country’s maternal mortarity ratio is at 675 per 100,000 live births.

Rea (21 years)and Judith (26 years) from Sambakusi agreed with their colleagues that once they are trained in midwifery, there will be fewer deaths of mothers and babies due to pregnancy. Judith like Ruth were volunteers. Judith was a government growth monitoring volunteer. ‘I have seen women delivering at health centre with support from guardians since the midwife was assisting other mothers. How can one midwife deliver three babies at one time?’ She wondered. As they debated and joked about how it could be done, the Project Officer, Sam Kanyemba, reminded them that this is the very reason they were recruited for. All the girls assured Malawi Red Cross Society that they are ready to prevent maternal and infant deaths in their community.

Malawi need more midwives. According to Lennie Kamwendo of the White Ribbon Alliance that advocates for safe motherhood, the midwife to patient ratio in Malawi is 1:272 while the recommended ratio is 1:5. The Program Manager, George Mwimaniwa, believes that support from Korean Red Cross, Community Chest of Korea and Sumsang will contribute to health system strengthening in Malawi."||Timeline Photos|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/617269521738151/?substory_index=0|3.0|||photo|2015-04-27T13:31:14+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) has been awarded a certificate as the best C4D delivery in Emergencies for community mobilization using door to door house visits.
UNICEF Malawi presented the certificate to MRCS on Tuesday at Mount Soche Hotel in Blantyre during the sixth Communication for Development (C4D) learning lab. 

UNICEF Malawi C4D manager Elnur Aliyev commended MRCS for the role it plays in C4D.

To support sharing of information and learning the UNICEF Malawi C4D unit established the learning lab in 2015, a platform for sharing C4D-related work for all practitioners and experts within the C4D field.

Social and cultural norms affecting child’s health, protection and development remain a critical determining factor in improving attitudes and practices towards children’s rights in Malawi. 

UNICEF Malawi through its Communication for Development Unit supports government in defining Social behavior change communication strategies for engaging with communities and influencing social and behavior change. The unit currently focuses on generating evidence on strategies for addressing negative social norms and harmful practices including documentation of what works in C4D, mobilizing partnerships for Social and behavior change, and building capacity to support implementation of C4D interventions.

The sixth lab focused on reviewing progress made in 2017, challenges and lessons learnt to improve and strengthen C4D programming. The lab accentuated evidence generation, capacity strengthening for C4D, real time documentation and analyzing strategies for amplifying voices to address social norms being used and promoted by different experts in the field.
 
Over the years MRCS has been engaged by government, UNICEF and other partners in door to door community mobilization a C4D tool that has proved to be effective and evidence based.

MRCS volunteers are with support from UNICEF are currently doing interpersonal communication for Emergency Cholera outbreak preparedness and response through door to door community mobilization visits in 8 districts along the lake shores of Lake Malawi, Malombe and Lake Chilwa, targeting 500,000 fishermen, fishing communities and cholera outbreak prone communities. 

The objective of the campaign is to increase awareness and knowledge and improve health seeking practices on cholera prevention and response among vulnerable population.
Over 800 volunteers have been mobilized and trained for the campaign. The certificate has since been dedicated to the hard working MRCS volunteers across the country."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1259431087521988/|8.0|||photo|2017-11-11T10:50:27+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) has introduced a new project in Chikwawa, Nsanje and Zomba that is earmarked to enhance cooperation among various stakeholders in responding to natural disasters.

MRCS’s Disaster Risk Reduction Officer for Chikwawa Darius Chiwaula presented the project during District Executive Committee (DEC) meeting in Chikwawa on Thursday.
Dubbed ‘Enhancing resilience in Malawi’ the project aims at strengthening Malawian authorities, local communities and Disaster Management stakeholders’ capacities to urgently act to natural hazards when they occur.

Said Chiwaula: “The project lives to ensure that inhabitants from disaster prone Group Village Heads (GVHs) within the Traditional Authority Makhuwira in Chikwawa, Ndamera in Nsanje and Mwambo in Zomba have increased capacities with regards to community based disaster preparedness structures, response and early recovery mechanisms in order to reduce the impact of natural disasters.”

According to Chiwaula, the project which is being financed by European Union Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO) will benefit over 240,000 beneficiaries in all the three districts.
And you should also be aware that the project action contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 6, 11 and 13 directly where issues of no poverty, clean water and sanitation, sustainable cities and communities as well as climate action are addressed,” he added.

Chikwawa is one of the districts which experiences natural hazards almost every year citing the devastating floods in 2015 followed by dry spells in 2016.

The project will be implemented with technical support from the Belgian Red Cross and with crucial support from two additional Red Cross Societies which are leading results which conform to their own technical specialties. 

The Netherlands Red Cross is leading an innovative drone based hazard and risk mapping exercise which will identify the area’s most prone to flooding and droughts, informing the target areas of the project and improving the accuracy and effectiveness of responses. Additionally the mapping supports the identification of zones which are most suitable for evacuation sites. 

The Danish Red Cross are developing the capacity of the MRCS to implement rapid Unconditional Cash Transfers, ensuring that vital support is available to affected communities immediately following any natural disaster. Additionally the Danish Red Cross are implementing an innovative Forecast Based Financing Pilot, the first of its kind in Malawi.  

Utilizing the improved mapping and data analysis capacity developed by the NLRC the Forecast Based Financing will be able to identify with greater accuracy beneficiaries who will likely be affected by disasters ahead of time, thereby preparing the communities for early action.  

The project blends cutting edge mapping and monitoring technology with simple and reliable community based monitoring tools to identify and track hazards.  Interventions which are appropriate to the local setting, easily replicated and implemented in remote rural areas have been adopted to support disaster preparedness and capacity building exercises will equip volunteers with the skills to rapidly disseminate information and to guide their communities to safety whenever necessary.

Over the next 18 months the Four Red Cross Societies will collaborate to prepare the most disaster prone villages to become more resilient, prepared and capable of withstanding the unpredictable impacts of natural hazards."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1236185963179834/|5.0|||photo|2017-09-30T13:26:49+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Over 800 leaners from Mafutsa Primary School and Nyankhwi Community Based Child Care Center in Dedza, with financial support amounting to around 16 Million Malawi Kwacha from the Rissho Kosei-kai ‘Donate-a-Meal Fund for Peace’ of Japan, on Thursday joined other schools in Chikwawa, Mwanza, Salima and Ntchisi districts on the list of beneficiaries of the school feeding program implemented by Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS).

Speaking at Mafutsa Primary school during the handover of items marking the launch of the school feeding project, MRCS Secretary General Mr. McBain Kanongodza urged the school committees and community members to take care of the items and use them for the intended purpose. He stressed that the objective of the school feeding project is to increase leaners enrolment, reduce dropout and sustain food availability in pre and primary schools by means of community gardening using the farm inputs provided by the project. “The harvested crop yields will sustain their meal requirements in form of porridge”. Kanongodza said.

Anna Katunga senior inspector of primary schools for Dedza district said government appreciates the role MRCS is playing in lifting the education standard by providing porridge to primary and pre-schools in the country.
 
MRCS with support from the Rissho Kosei-kai Donate-a-Meal Fund for Peace of Japan has been supporting school feeding program at Chiphazi Primary School, targeting 972 Learners (495 boys, 477 girls) and Kawaliza Day care center targeting 448 learners in Dedza from 2014.

 A total of 19,000 learners have benefited from the 486 million Kwacha made available by Danish Red Cross, Italian Red Cross and Finish Red Cross in Chikwawa and Mwanza, Japan Red Cross in Ntchisi and Swiss Red Cross in Salima for similar intervention."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1227984757333288/|4.0|||photo|2017-09-19T07:56:30+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

In a bid to build capacity of girls to plan their sexual and reproductive health, rights and career, Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) established girl groups in secondary schools in the districts of Mwanza, Chikwawa and Mangochi under the Community Resilience Project supported by a consortium of Danish Red Cross, Finish Red Cross, Icelandic Red Cross and Italian Red Cross. The purpose of the girl group project is to promote girls’ empowerment in secondary schools by addressing gender discrimination and promoting equality.

Speaking in Mangochi at St Michaels girls Secondary school during the closing ceremony of a one week long girls camp organized with funding from the Danish Red Cross, Kirstine Primdal Sutton, Danish Red Cross country delegate said the project aims to empower the girls to be self-assertive, improve their self-esteem, make effective decisions and address many of the problems facing the girls.

Gloria Kwalira a form 3 student at Chapananga community day Secondary School said she has benefited a lot from the girl’s camp. “When I was coming here I didn’t know some of the rights that we have as girls. We have learnt a lot of things that have opened our minds. Having interacted with the role models that came to share with us their experiences, I feel the sky is the limit.” Gloria said. She thanked the Malawi Red Cross for the girl groups’ project.

In his remarks, MRCS Director of Programs and Development Hastings Kandaya advised the girls to take their studies seriously.  He thanked the Danish Red Cross youth and volunteers for the support and for participating in the girls camp.

The district commissioner for Mangochi Rev. Moses Chimphepo who graced the occasion, echoed senior chief Chowe’s remarks saying the girls are lucky to have organisations such as the Red Cross establish the girl groups and the camp. He urged the girls to work hard at school and adhere to the school regulations so that the project’s interventions should not be in vain.

During the girls camp, the activities included, inter-school debates on issues which affect girl child, girl mentoring, interface meetings with influential members of the society, poems, peer education, sporting and career guidance talks.

The girls camp was held under a theme “My confidence is bigger than my fears”"||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1215625115235919/|12.0|||photo|2017-08-27T09:22:44+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) has called on the local leaders, the community and the caregivers to give children the necessary support in order to reduce school dropouts in the country.

Leonard Maganga, Branch, Youth Development and Resource Mobilisation Manager for MRCS made the remarks at Kamwamboni Community Based Care Centre (CBCC) in Ntchisi during the donation of assorted items worthy K20 million to four CBCCs in the area of Traditional Authority Kalumo.

“The donation is part of the project that MRCS in partnership with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) with funding from Japanese Red Cross is implementing on HIV/Aids which aims at supporting orphans and vulnerable children as well as the people who are chronically ill. The project is supporting the children attending the CBCCs and those in secondary schools with school fees and leaning materials,” said Maganga.  

He said the provision of porridge at CBCCs, among other things helps in reducing dropout rate among toddlers.

Apart from looking at CBCCs, MRCS is also giving them farm inputs, one of the sustainability mechanisms which will assist the communities to start producing crops such as maize, soya and ground nuts which they can use to make porridge for the children after the project phases out.

Chairperson for Kamwamboni CBCC, James Ngoma, and Group Village Headman Chitete thanked MRCS for the support saying it will go a long way in making sure that children are taking part in the Early Childhood Development program.

Kinsess Chimtendere, a form four student at Pherere Community Secondary School in Ntchisi, thanked MRCS for the assistant rendered to her since she was selected to the secondary school in 2014.

“I am an orphan and I do not have any relative who can pay school fees for me. Fortunately MRCS came to my rescue by paying school fees and giving me some of the items that I require during school days such as uniform, notebooks and school shoe,” said Chimtendere.

MRCS is also doing the pass on goats program in order to economically empower the communities and the caregivers. Currently 40 goats have been distributed to 40 families. The pass on program is expected to reach to over 160 families."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1207462926052138/|7.0|||photo|2017-08-13T08:12:01+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

A total of 1,500 Karonga floods survivors were all smiles over the week after they received money through cash transfer totaling to about K63 Million from Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS), thanks to Danish Red Cross. 

According to MRCS acting Disaster Manager Roster Kufandiko, the assistance from Danish Red Cross is unconditional. He said that the beneficiaries were at liberty to use the money based on different needs to uplift their livelihood after the disaster.

Kufandiko thanked Danish Red Cross for the support saying this was not the only support the Danish Red Cross helped the Malawi floods survivors this year. He said about 350 beneficiaries received K28 millon in Salima in the past months through cash transfer.

One of the beneficiaries, 50 years old Rose Nakanyika thanked MRCS for the Donation. Nakanyika said she would use the money to buy food and iron sheets to rehabilitate her house which was destroyed during the floods.

Over 6,000 households were displaced by floods that hit Karonga in February this year. Since then, MRCS has been helping the beneficiaries with assorted relief items with support from it partners.

Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS), in partnership with Telekom Networks Malawi, has donated a speed boat to the people of Likoma and Chizumulu islands to assist in disaster response. 

MRCS Branch, Youth and Resource Mobilisation manager Leonard Maganga said, after handing over the boat in Nkhata Bay on Monday, that the donation is part of MRCS’s commitment to assist disaster victims. 

“It was last year when we had some floods in the Northern Region and some of the districts that were affected were Mzuzu and Karonga. So, when we linked up with TNM and its partners, they pulled their resources together to support the victims through Red Cross. 

“When the support came, we also thought of the people of Likoma who frequently face challenges because of the isolation of the district,” he said. 

He said Red Cross also hopes that the speed boat worth about K4 million will address other emergency issues such as maternal and neonatal cases as well as issues of drowning. 

Maganga appealed to authorities to take care of the boat so that it serves the islands better. 

“As Red Cross, we support government initiatives and we work through volunteers. Sometimes when people are given support like this one, they may not value the importance of the donation. We are looking forward to volunteers taking care of the boat so that it may serve the purpose for a relatively longer period,” he said. 

Likoma district commissioner Charles Mwawembe said the district does not have a reliable means of transport. 

“Our transport system is programmed. We travel twice a week between Likoma and the mainland. This means that anything happening in between those days is a disaster. In fact, as residents of Likoma we are a disaster on our own,” he said. 

Mwawembe said the district is also handicapped in emergency response, particularly when referring patients for further medical attention to the mainland. 

He said the donation is worthwhile as it will address such challenges. 

“We have been lobbying with partners, well-wishers and donors if they could come and support us as a district. On our own we don’t have the capacity to own such facilities. 

“So, today is a great day for us to get the speed boat, specifically to assist us in areas of Red Cross activities to serve the two islands of Chizumulu and Likoma,” he said."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1200119423453155/|13.0|||photo|2017-08-03T02:16:01+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848

First Aid, Shelter Construction, Camp Management, Disaster Assessment and Search and Rescue formed part of the National Disaster Response Team (NDRT) training organised by Malawi Red Cross Society (MRCS) for 36 Volunteers and staff.

Speaking on Friday in Lilongwe at the end of the First Aid training which is part of the NDRT training, Hastings Kandaya, MRCS Acting Secretary General who is also the Director of Programs said the objective of the training is to improve preparedness and response before, during and after disasters. On first Aid training Kandaya said the training has built capacity of the MRCS staff and volunteers, who can now serve lives by providing First Aid service. 

“The focus of NDRT training is generally on improving the technical skills of the participants, but also on personnel and team management. It aims to encourage and exchange of experience and knowledge and the creation of networks among the disaster managers. It also aims to improve coordination of disaster response and the quality and availability of disaster management tools,” Kandaya said.

“Let me thank Malawi Defense Force for providing Search and Rescue training during the NDRT training and Community Resilience Project which funded the training with financial support from a consortium of Danish Red Cross, Finish Red Cross, Icelandic Red Cross and Italian Red Cross.” Said  Kandaya. 

In country Danish Red Cross delegate and consortium coordinator Kirstine Primdal said she was happy to see that the training was conducted. She said it was very important to have staff and volunteers trained in NDRT and First Aid in particular. She added that the skills will benefit the communities which we serve. “All over the world the Red Cross is well known as the largest first aid service provider and to have MRCS staff and volunteers who form part of the Red Cross movement, trained in first aid means that more and more lives will be served.” Said Kirstine.

The first Aid training was facilitated by MRCS Fisrt Aid National Master Trainer Alick Msusa. Msusa said he was pleased to note that more people are learning first Aid. He however urged individuals and Companies to get up to date first Aid training from MRCS which is the largest first Aid service provider in Malawi.

National Disaster Response Teams comprise of National Society staff and volunteers, often from different branches trained and working alongside Red Cross volunteers at community level to bring assistance to people affected by disaster.

They are made up of generalists and specialists in health, logistics, relief, disaster management and water and sanitation. NDRT can be mobilised at short notice and are trained to work as a team and support the local Red Cross branch in its response to disasters."||Photos from Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS's post|https://www.facebook.com/358869244244848/posts/1195234427274988/|6.0|||photo|2019-06-27T17:17:02+0000||Malawi Red Cross Society - MRCS|358869244244848
