He said Kirstine was one delegate that wanted things to move. She was ready to assist the National society achieve its objectives. MRCS Secretary General McBain Kanongodza said Kirstine contributed a lot to the development of the National Society. He cited the establishment of youth leader exchange visits programs between the Malawian youth and the Danish, Icelandic and Finnish youths as a big capacity building for the national society. In her remarks, Kirstine said she was happy to see MRCS going through the organizational restructuring through the Turnaround strategy.
